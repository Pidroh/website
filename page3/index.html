        February Week 2 - Accidents happen

    <p><strong>CARD NOVA / GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>Ok, first week of a break from Generic RPG Idle. Feels weird.
My computer suddenly had a battery issue. Took me 3 days to fix that. I worked using another computer in the mean time but since I didn’t wanna setup my projects on the other computer, I didn’t work much. I did work though.</p>

<p>Card Nova Hyper I have recently changed the small capsule and the first screenshot of the game. Hopefully this improves the performance of the Steam page. You can see the new screenshot here:
https://store.steampowered.com/app/2197330/CARD_NOVA_HYPER/
And the new capsule by clicking here:
https://store.steampowered.com/search/?term=card+nova+hyper</p>

<p>My card game prototype is also going great. I’m not feature complete but I’m close. Steam Next Fest registration is up until March 16 so I’ll see if I can make that deadline for a little spin off title!</p>

<hr />

<p>Here is the time table for week 6 of 2023:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2023 W:06 manager    :  2:36:00
2023 W:06 monster    : 33:57:00
2023 W:06 hrpg       :  0:14:00
2023 W:06 burocracy  :  0:32:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>SO yeah, computer broken, less hours worked on the game. But things are going.
This week I’ll also rest on GRI. And then the next one I’ll rest too. After that development should resume.</p>

<p>Let’s goo!</p>

    <p><strong>CARD NOVA / GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>Last days to get Generic RPG Idle!!
This week I ended up doing 10 hours of Generic RPG Idle related tasks! Considering I wanted to take a 3/4 week break from it, I failed lol.</p>

<hr />

<p>Here is the time table for week 5 of 2023:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2023 W:05 monster    : 30:48:00
2023 W:05 hrpg       : 10:43:00
2023 W:05 manager    :  3:14:00
2023 W:05 neos       :  1:27:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>8 hours of streaming this week! And on only 3 days. It really helps concentration!
Since I don’t wanna build just the card game while I’m taking a break from GRI, I’m thinking about starting on the next prototype.</p>

<p>This new update set a new record of sales for GRI, so that was awesome!! Thanks everyone for your support!</p>

    <span class="post-date">30 Jan 2023</span>

    <p><strong>CARD NOVA / GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>The new update is up for Generic RPG Idle!!
The sale starts at 10am Pacific Time!</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time this week doing release stuff for GRI. I also added some requested features and fixed some small issues.</p>

<hr />

<p>Here is the time table for week 4 of 2023:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2023 W:04 monster    : 18:57:00
2023 W:04 hrpg       : 31:09:00
2023 W:04 manager    :  0:35:00
2023 W:04 burocracy  :  0:34:00
2023 W:04 marketing  :  0:54:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I did almost 5 hours of streaming this week. Not bad. Working on release stuff on GRI did stop me from streaming more. We’ll see how that goes.</p>

<p>Since I have decided to work on GRI 10 hours per week for a while, I think I’ll take a two week break from it. I mean, there is some stuff I still have to do related to the release but I won’t do more than that.</p>

<p>Forgot to update the trailer in the Steam page, will do that now!</p>

<p>Hope people like the update!!
Peace!</p>

<p>Beta is still going for GRI, instructions are here:</p>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1858120/view/5281067109624265833">Beta instructions</a></p>

<p>I have submitted Generic RPG Idle for BitSummit!!! Really hope I can participate.
I wanted to send Card Nova Hyper too, but it requires a playable build. Next year, I guess.</p>

<hr />

<p>Here is the time table for week 3:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2023 W:03 monster    : 24:07:00

2023 W:03 marketing  :  0:18:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I streamed for around four hours. I don’t really wanna focus too much on it, but I do want to increase my hours. Maybe I can focus on increasing the hours in February.</p>

    <p><strong>CARD NOVA / GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>I have FINALLY finished the “Sound of Art” update for Generic RPG Idle, which adds sound to the game. This one required collaboration with multiple professionals to make happen. Good thing is my sound code is fairly stable now. That means I’ll have an easier time when doing sound for CARD NOVA!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj6t1ohP9g4">===&gt; NEW TRAILER &lt;===</a></p>

<p>I have a beta available for the new version of GRI, instructions are here:</p>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1858120/view/5281067109624265833">Beta instructions</a></p>

<p>Card Nova’s prototype is going well. I am considering sharing some WIP artwork, not sure.</p>

<hr />

<p>Here is the time table for week 2:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2023 W:02 monster    	 : 34:45:00
2023 W:02 manager    	 :  1:24:00
2023 W:02 hrpg       	 : 13:23:00
2023 W:02 monster_stream :  1:40:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I streamed! And I also measured it. It increases my concentration, so I am trying to stream development. I don’t really have a schedule right now, just do it periodically. I’ll try to expand the number of hours I stream weekly, if it feels sustainable I’ll consider deciding on a schedule.</p>

  What is Brave Ball?

  Your weapon is a soccer ball. In an action RPG with turn-based mechanics.<br><br>

  If that sounds awesome to you like it does to me, <b>wishlist</b> the game to know when it comes out! <br><br>
  It increases the chances of the game being successful too, which means more updates! And more updates means a better game for everybody!
