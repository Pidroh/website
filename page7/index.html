        Steam Fest ended :(
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">11 Oct 2021</span>

    <p>Brave Ball went strong on Steam Fest!</p>

<p><img src="/website/assets/steamfest.png" alt="Brave Ball on Steam Fest screenshot" /></p>

<p>I’m currently prototyping the RPG mechanics as a browser game!
And soon <strong>everyone</strong> will be able to play the prototype! That means you, reader!</p>

<p>Currently the balance is super bad though. And it’s an idle game, so, not sure if everyone will like it.</p>

<p>I’ll post a link here in October 18th!!</p>

<p>Here is the time table for this week (week 40 of 2021):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2021-10 W:40 marketing  :  3:04:00
2021-10 W:40 housework  :  0:16:00
2021-10 W:40 manager    :  2:04:00
2021-10 W:40 hrpg       : 17:29:00
2021-10 W:40            :  0:01:00
2021-10 W:40 auto       :  5:24:00

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Around 23 hours of programming in!!! Nice!</p>

<p>Marketing is now down to 3 hours. This makes sense because I didn’t really have any new screenshots to show or pages to seetup.</p>

<p>This week is mainly the haxe prototype but I am kinda stuck in knowing how much I should balance VS adding new features. Hard to make a prototype fun when it doesn’t have enough features.</p>

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Oct 2021</span>

    <p>Brave Ball is on Steam Fest so I hope more people are playing the demo!</p>

<p><img src="/website/assets/steamfest.png" alt="My helpful screenshot" /></p>

<p>I also got a lot of feedback from people so it’s a good chance to improve the game.
There are some input bugs that I need to fix and I’m fixing about changing the input system backend. Unity is really troublesome!!!</p>

<p>Here is the time table for this week (week 39 of 2021):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2021-09 W:39 turn       :  4:04:00
2021-09 W:39 hrpg       :  7:49:00
2021-09 W:39 marketing  :  4:22:00
2021-10 W:39 hrpg       :  8:53:00
2021-10 W:39 turn       :  4:56:00
2021-10 W:39 marketing  :  2:00:00
2021-10 W:39 manager    :  2:30:00
2021-10 W:39 designer   :  1:29:00
2021-10 W:39 automation :  3:02:00
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Unfortunately week 39 is split between September and October. 24 hours of programming in!!! Nice!</p>

<p>Marketing is like six hours, not sure on how I feel about that.</p>

<p>Programming is split between turn, which is basically Unity stuff. hrpg is mainly me prototyping the RPG mechanisms of the game in Haxe. I wanna write about that more later.</p>

        Project Planning for a single developer
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">26 Sep 2021</span>

    <h1 id="problem">Problem</h1>
<p>I am trying to find a better way to structure the way I work as a single developer. 
I find that I have a lot of “stuck thinking” time because I wear many hats at the same time. When I should be doing programming, I’ll sometimes be stuck thinking about game design or about the graphics. Or I’ll be stuck thinking “should I be doing something else?!”.</p>

<p>The good thing about working as a team is that people decide as a team and then you go do your work. If you think you should be working on something else, then you need to wait to talk about that in the next meeting. But if you’re a single developer you can be very agile and change what you are doing freely. This creates a lot of flexibility but it also makes a lot of things bad.</p>

<h3 id="bad-performance-because-of-context-switching">Bad performance because of context-switching</h3>
<p>thinking about project management or game design while I should be programming</p>
<h3 id="wandering-in-the-desert">Wandering in the desert</h3>
<p>Allowing me to change what I am doing in the heat of the moment or get stuck thinking about it makes it more likely I am not working towards the “vision of the project”</p>
<h3 id="hard-to-commit">Hard to commit</h3>
<p>I will sometimes schedule time for marketing but then make a decision that “I don’t need to do marketing lately because of X”, then go on to program.
I think that by delaying that decision to later, I can make a more informed decision.</p>

<h1 id="solution">Solution</h1>
<h3 id="weekly-public-management-blog">Weekly public management blog</h3>
<p>Write weekly about how the week went and post times for each profession.</p>

<h3 id="schedule-time-for-each-profession">Schedule time for each profession</h3>
<p>Every profession should try to do only their minimal time, while the programmer can work as much as they want.
If there is not enough time to do the work, they should write a note for the team meeting.</p>

    <p><em>Tell us what you think of the new art direction for the scenario!</em></p>

<p>Pedro from Pidroh Games here! Hope everyone is doing fine!</p>

<p>Lately I have decided to improve the art direction for the scenario and made some experiments.
You can see the 3 current ideas for areas we have in the gif below.
<img src="/website/assets/gameplay_scenariochange.gif" alt="My helpful screenshot" /></p>

<p>We think the new balance of light, darkness and contrast makes the game easier to play.

  What is Brave Ball?
  </h1>
  Your weapon is a soccer ball. In an action RPG with turn-based mechanics.<br><br>

  If that sounds awesome to you like it does to me, <b>wishlist</b> the game to know when it comes out! <br><br>
  It increases the chances of the game being successful too, which means more updates! And more updates means a better game for everybody!
