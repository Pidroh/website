        November 3rd Week: Generic RPG Idle item system revamp
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">22 Nov 2021</span>

    <p>I have changed how the item system works. Items now have names, different types, and different rarities. This allows for a higher range of play styles than before.</p>

<p><strong>BE WARNED</strong></p>

<p><strong>THE PROTOTYPE IS VERY SIMPLE AND BORING. YOU KINDA JUST LEAVE IT RUNNING IN THE BROWSE, CHOOSE YOUR EQUIPMENT AND WHERE TO FIGHT</strong></p>

<p>You can try it here: https://github.com/Pidroh/GenericRPGIdle</p>

<p>Here is the time table for this week (week 46 of 2021):</p>

2021-11 W:46 designer   :  2:27:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Lots of programming but a lot of it wasn’t so productive. I feel like I spent a lot of time rethinking things, having analysis paralysis and just play testing too much. But still, 36 hours making the game is nice.</p>

<p>Next update will take a while and will feature magic. It will change how the game is played quite a bit.</p>

        November 2st Week: Generic RPG Idle battle system entering the last phase
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">15 Nov 2021</span>

    <p>I have added a prestige system to Generic RPG to make the game a bit more dynamic. It plays well with the newly added bosses, I think.</p>

<p>I have finished the full specification for the RPG systems in Brave Ball! With this in hand, I now have the long road ahead of implementing all of those systems in Generic RPG Idle. I have also decided to do the map system in Haxe. A lot of development will be happening there, I want to develop it in an easier to prototype environment.</p>

<p>Less programming. 11 hours of me thinking and writing down the systems for Brave Ball! 23 hours for Generic RPG, not bad.</p>

        November 1st Week: Back to Brave Ball a bit
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">09 Nov 2021</span>

    <p>Added new bosses to the prototype!!! They give permanent stat upgrades. I did add further cutscenes to the game, but stopped myself from adding goals. The reason for that is because adding goals would make for a better game, I might not use it in Brave Ball. I might reconsider adding a similar system to Brave Ball though.</p>

<p>I also wrote all the cutscenes that will be in the Brave Ball demo! It was super fun.
Now I need to write code to integrate the cutscenes with the map. Not sure if I should write new map code in Haxe and do the integration in Haxe… Or move over to C# and do it there.</p>

<p>26 hours programming the prototype and 12 hours planning and writing cutscenes for Brave Ball! Not bad!
Right now I’m adding a prestige system to HRPG, which might make it into Brave Ball. This Saturday I’ll make a decision on where to integrate the cutscenes to the map.</p>

<p>My times are back to normal hahahaha no more 30 hour programming in a week. Makes sense! I had to stop by the hospital too, which is a huge time drain.</p>

<p>While I have some cutscenes in the game, I’m expanding on that. Also having more clearly defined, visible goals in the game.</p>

<p>This week I got way more work in. This post, though, was supposed to be posted yesterday, so that is bad.
Marketing and designer time went up. I was kinda lost during that designer time, so I’m not sure if it was quality time being spent, but maybe it was necessary.</p>

<p>I have stopped a bit on the RPG mechanics and started to create the code for the story. Hopefully I can get story cutscenes working before Friday but that may be tough.</p>

  What is Brave Ball?
  </h1>
  Your weapon is a soccer ball. In an action RPG with turn-based mechanics.<br><br>

  If that sounds awesome to you like it does to me, <b>wishlist</b> the game to know when it comes out! <br><br>
  It increases the chances of the game being successful too, which means more updates! And more updates means a better game for everybody!
