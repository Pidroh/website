        January 2nd Week - Next version still in development!

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Jan 2022</span>

    <p>Things are the same as last week! Still working hard on the new update for the game that will change the UI and the looks of the game big time. 
While I’m getting that ready, there aren’t any updates in the game for now.</p>

<p>You can try the game here: https://pidroh.github.io/GenericRPGIdle/</p>

<p>Here is the time table for this week (week 1 of 2022):</p>

2022 W:01 designer   :  0:20:00

<p>Got 34 hours in. I’m almost done with the new version. Should be coming next week. Where I live is getting pretty cold, hope everyone is safe during these times.</p>

<p>It’s a bit confusing but I guess I got 25 hours in of working on Generic RPG Idle. Not bad.</p>

<p>I plan to finish the artwork rework soon. The problem is that it will come with a bunch of broken stuff that will need fixing. Maybe the next build will only come in two weeks.</p>

<p>HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time working on a new build system to handle the multiple versions of the game. It’s in multiple sites now. I have also spent way too much time thinking about the graphics of the game. I’ll have to rethink everything going forward with the game when I add more cutscenes to the game.</p>

    <p>Upgrading equipment and the dark theme is in the Itch IO version! I’ll upload the github version later. 
I have developed a system for magical skills and elemental damage. I am working on revising the UI.</p>

<p>30 hours done on programming, mainly because I was in the hospital. Maybe I got a bit more work since I screwed up the tracking with all the little things in the hospital. Not sure. The surgery went great so all is well! My nose is still getting clogged up but things are great.</p>

<p>I’ll add some UI mockups at a later date! Let’s go HRPG!</p>

    <p>IN DEVELOPMENT: The ability to upgrade equipment. A new dark color scheme of the UI.
I might add an option for going back to the old color scheme if there is a wish for it.</p>

<p>While the game hasn’t changed from last week, you can try it here: https://github.com/Pidroh/GenericRPGIdle</p>

<p>25 hours programming, not so bad. A little bit less work done this week. I was kinda busy in the weekend.</p>

<p>I ended up delaying elemental spells to focus on upgrading equipment. So the last battle system expansion will be the elemental spells. That will likely come with an overhaul of Lagrima Continent, maybe.</p>

<p>I’m typing this from the hospital. My surgery is tomorrow. The hospital is pretty confortable so I guess I can get a lot of work done!</p>

  What is Brave Ball?
  </h1>
  Your weapon is a soccer ball. In an action RPG with turn-based mechanics.<br><br>

  If that sounds awesome to you like it does to me, <b>wishlist</b> the game to know when it comes out! <br><br>
  It increases the chances of the game being successful too, which means more updates! And more updates means a better game for everybody!
