    <span class="post-date">04 Apr 2022</span>

    <p>I fixed some small bugs and added some small features.  I tried to optimize the draw calls for the unity version but that was a can of worms. I don’t think I’ll do that for now.</p>

<p>You can try the game here: https://pidroh.github.io/GenericRPGIdle/</p>

<p>This week I will work tweaking the beginning of the game to make it more accessible. No big deal though. I also want to add keyboard support for popup messages. After that I’ll continue work on the feedback window. After that it’s either achievements or gamepad support.</p>

<p>Gotta keep going [2]</p>

    <p>A lot of progress was made in keyboard support. There must still be some small bugs though. I’ll probably need a moving cursor if I want to make keyboard input more obvious.</p>

<p>Right now I’m implementing a feedback form while also solving some small issues. The feedback form is requiring me to code a server for the game, which is a whole new experience.</p>

<p>This week wasn’t so productive. Had a fight with my SO which kinda threw me off balance emotionally :( things seem to be improving though.</p>

<p>It was gonna be keyboard =&gt; achievements =&gt; gamepad, but now it’s
keyboard =&gt; feedback form =&gt; achievements =&gt; gamepad</p>

<p>Gotta keep going.</p>

    <p>This week I added a way to automatically advance areas in the game. It takes a while to unlock, but it makes the game a lot more idle friendly. I’m now working on making the game being fully playable by using the keyboard. It was easier than I thought it would be, while at the same taking time because of unexpected bugs. It’s an ongoing progress.</p>

<p>You can try the original version here: https://pidroh.github.io/GenericRPGIdle/
You can try the remake here: https://pidroh.github.io/GenericRPGIdle/unstable_phaser</p>

<p>I also got some points on the current palette of the game… A lot to fix.</p>

<p>Keyboard will still take a while to get done. Maybe I’ll do keyboard =&gt; achievements =&gt; gamepad? 
I also need to worry about multiple screen resolution shenanigans…</p>

<p>Gotta keep going.</p>

    <p>The six first test achievements are in the game. They might changed or tweaked as the game progresses. I added local saves to the desktop version of the game. It was a HUGE mess. Had to change the library I use to create the jsons. It seems to be working. I have also managed to integrate the achievement system with Steam achievements, so that’s a win.</p>

<p>I did some small UI tweaks too.</p>

<p>Once again I mixed manager times with designer times. And I think I screwed up tracking hours on Friday. I think that is what happened anyways.</p>

<p>And off we go!</p>

    <span class="post-date">07 Mar 2022</span>

    <p>I have added tests and automation to the new version of the game. I have not brought over every feature from the original version yet. The new version has also has some new features, like correct piercing bonuses in Heavy Swords and Bastard Swords.</p>

<p>You can try the original version here: https://pidroh.github.io/GenericRPGIdle/
You can try the remake here: https://pidroh.github.io/GenericRPGIdle/unstable_phaser</p>

<p>Last week was mainly fixed bugs. This week, though, I’m starting to implement achievements into the game. Just 6 simple achievements as a test though, for starters.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I guess I ended up mixing designer times with manager times? Anyways, good times this week. I actually had a small accident and broke a tooth lol. But it’s already fixed. Dentists are fast, I tell you.</p>

<p>And off we go!</p>
