        July 4th Week - Preparing the Update
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">25 Jul 2022</span>

    <p><strong>GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>I decided to change directions. I decided on deprioritizing the story. So I won’t work on the story much until I can improve some of the things I’m not happy about in the game. Isabel’s story is a very small part of the GRI experience and You’s gameplay (I’m thinking of changing the name to Yuu) is pretty much the main meat of the game. I want to prioritize that first. I think that will result in a more engaging game and lay the fundation for improving both active gameplay and idle gameplay.</p>

<p>Right now I think that update 1 MIGHT have:
A) Visual effects
B) New exploration system
C) more Unknown tab content
D) Improved selling (maybe)
E) New items and skills (maybe)</p>

<p>While update 2 MIGHT have:
A) Visual effects and sound effects lol possibly music
B) Chapter 2 maybe
C) Offline progress and XP cap removal (maybe maybe)</p>

<hr />
<hr />

<p>Here is the time table for this week (week 28 of 2022):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2022 W:29 hrpg       : 23:58:00
2022 W:29 manager    :  5:37:00
2022 W:29 marketing  :  0:19:00
2022 W:29 hstory     :  0:01:00
2022 W:29 designer   :  2:24:00
2022 W:29 monster    :  9:10:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Nice hours. I decided to increase the time I spend on the monster card game to around 8 hours. After adding very basic enemy behavior, the card game is ALMOST playable but full of bugs. Maybe I can get something playable in a week or two? Looking forward to that.</p>

<p>It doesn’t have idle elements so I’m unsure on how I will get players at an early stage. I was thinking about keeping playtests private until the game is more polished. We will see.</p>

        July 3rd Week - Steam Early Access released!!
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 Jul 2022</span>

    <p><strong>GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>This week has been filled with bug fixes. Some of them I could have somehow caught beforehand, some that I just had to release and bite the bullet. I implemented 3 visual effects for the update. I’m not sure if I’ll do audio too or not. Maybe audio will come in update 2. The game made more money than what I was expecting, though I didn’t actually try to predict how much money it would make. It is by no means a hit, but it is doing much better than my previous Steam release 7 years ago, Daily Espada. I had one bad review but after addressing his problems he changed the review, which felt great.</p>

<p>Right now I think that update 1 MIGHT have:
A) Visual effects
B) more Unknown tab content
C) chapter 2 story complete
D) New items and skills (maybe)</p>

<p>While update 2 MIGHT have:
A) Visual effects and sound effects lol possibly music
B) Chapter 3 half or complete
C) Offline progress and XP cap removal (maybe maybe)</p>

<p>The Steam release kinda got me in a groove so I had some nice hours this week. The card game prototype is still going slowwwwww. I feel like I’m overengineering it by writing organized code, not sure if it will be worth it in the long run or not. We will see.</p>

<p>Anyways, feels great to finally have a new released game again, that people think it is worth their money. Gonna keep going!</p>

        July 2nd Week - Getting ready for Early Access release (3)
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">11 Jul 2022</span>

    <p><strong>GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>I finished up what one part of the addition to the new resource management system (Unknown tab). I also wrote all cutscenes of chapter 2, but only half of it is implemented in the early access release. I still need to integrate the rest of the cutscenes of chapter 2 in a later update. Right now I am changing the way I handle sprites in the game so I don’t have to add them manually to the game code. By automating this, it will be simpler to add new sprites and also simpler to add Spine animations to the game.</p>

<p>Spine will be my main animation tool for effects which is a departure because all my previous games that had a lot of effects (Daily Espada, Jobchanger Brigade, even my older games like Dragon Sky Rush) were all heavily dependant on particle systems. Hopefully this will mean more polished games? Hehehe, who knows. Which unfortunately means I am switching the focus from content to polishing, at least for a while. This is the first time I’m focusing on the appearance / marketability of the game. Since I’m creating a lot of systems from scratch, expanding my “engine” to have better integration with Spine is a good long-term investment.</p>

<p>So I think after early access, I’ll do a big update that will have:
A) lots of visual effects and sound effects lol possibly music
B) more Unknown tab content
C) chapter 2 story complete</p>

<p>There are also some small bugs that I need to investigate regarding noblesse and Mystic Elf, but I am afraid of updating the current Steam build and breaking things before the release, so I will fix them at a later date :( :(</p>

<p>I might also revamp the upgrade system but maybe I’ll leave that for a future update.

2022 W:27 monster    :  6:24:00
2022 W:27 hstory     :  1:30:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These hours are good, considering I was busy for my birthday yesterday. I am splitting content between hstory and hcontent, so around 3 hours is nice. The card game prototype (Monster) is not progressing as fast as I hoped. The drag-and-drop oriented UI changes a lot from how I was handling UI in Generic RPG Idle. But once I get through that it should move faster. I’m still limitting myself to 5 hours (it goes to 6 and half because I lose track of time, but I force myself to stop once I realize it). I don’t know if I’ll increase the time I spend on this side project or not.</p>

<p>Anyways, let’s keep going! TOMORROW IS THE STEAM RELEASE!!!!!!!!!!! (I think)</p>

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Jul 2022</span>

    <p>I am currently expanding more on the new resource management system. I think I’ll release the Early Access version next 12 of July. Two days after my birthday lol. I do feel a bit lost now though. Too many things running in my mind… I feel that if I keep polishing this game, I could release it on consoles. At the same time, I also feel like I need to finish it up and move on to different games. It gives me a headache everytime I think about it.</p>

<p>Work is also progressing on my new card game prototype. This week wasn’t so productive, met some friends and got hooked up on the new soccer anime. But still, 22 hours of development isn’t so bad.</p>

        June 4th Week - Getting ready for Early Access release
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">27 Jun 2022</span>

    <p>I have decided on a Steam release date for the game. Haven’t announced it yet because I’m not sure if I can make it D: but I think I can, unless some horrible problem comes up. This week I wrote some story for chapter 2 (I should have done this sooner). I wanted to release the Early Access version with the entirety of chapter 2, but I am not sure I can make it. Which means that early access might launch with half of chapter 2. I have two reasons for that:</p>

<p>1) I did some major rebalancing of the game’s Soul Crush system last week, to test that stuff I need some new simple dev tools
2) The game had some issues for people with big screens and I added that last week
3) The steam page still has screens and trailer from the last version. I might do something about this, not sure.</p>

<p>I decide to rebalance the game now because I want people to be able to import their saves. The rebalance means that advance people will lose their Soul Crush / Challenge Area progress. Figured it was better do that sooner than later.</p>

<p>Here is the time table for this week (week 25 of 2022):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2022 W:25 manager    :  1:50:00
2022 W:25 marketing  :  1:58:00
2022 W:25 hrpg       : 24:09:00
2022 W:25 hstory     :  3:53:00
2022 W:25 design     :  1:08:00
2022 W:25 monster    :  5:58:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Those hours are nice. Anyways, me and my SO did break up but the relationship was decaying, so that was good in the long run, I believe. Anyways, this week I’ll continue making some debugging tools and make what content I can out of chapter 2. The Steam page overhaul might come later, on the first big update of the game.</p>

<p>It took a long time to release what was supposed to be a very small prototype for some game mechanics… I’m glad I did decide on a deadline for it, because the way I’m working in the game, I could keep developing the game forever. Let us keep going strong!</p>
