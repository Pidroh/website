    <p><strong>GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>I released a small beta for the changes. I got some nice feedback and made some adjustments. Things SEEM fine. No bugs coming up yet.</p>

<p>Next update:
A) Equipment screen update
B) Battle screen update
C) Chapter 2
D) QOL</p>

<p>The boost from 10 reviews was dying but then I posted the game on feedback friday asking for feedback on the beta. Some folks ignored the beta instructions part and just bought the game straight away. I think the (positive) label is also improving quality of when I post the game for people to see. People know the game isn’t broken because of the positive reviews and all. This is just a theory, but since conversion rate is probably increased, every person I send to Steam is a high quality visit which makes Steam want to promote the page a little bit. And since conversion rate is also up when Steam promotes the page, the boost is bigger. What I want to say is that the 10 reviews thing really creates a cummulative positive effect for everything you do Steam related.

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>PRODUCTIVITY IS BACK BABY! Didn’t even notice it. I think it’s because I got pretty engaged in finish up the update. Also I finished a big part of the documents of registering the company. It already exists and all. After I get the tax information set up I’ll transfer my Steam games to the company.</p>

<p>Goooooooooooo!</p>

<p>The battle UI is almost done. There are just some small features and animations that need to be redone. I’m starting to get excited about this. The game just feels different. Can’t wait to get this to players.</p>

<p>Productivity is still a bit down lately. Wonder why. Still, I have a full time job… Maybe my productivity was just too high before?</p>

<p>Anyways, I’ll keep going!! Hopefully this visual update boosts sales significantly.</p>

    <p><strong>GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>The battle UI is still going, slowly. The game is slowly coming into shape. The story is giving me trouble because there are a lot of stages and the backgrounds have to be set manually. The new animations for the main character should be coming in later this week. No idea if I’ll make a new trailer or not. Sound effects will probably come at a different update so maybe I should wait for sound effects before updating the trailer? Or just create a quick 15 second trailer myself? I don’t know what to do. The look of the game is going to change a lot but I don’t really want to do two trailers. Might not have a choice though.</p>

<p>Productivity went down last week. Lately I have been hooked in a show called Ozark and I haven’t been so motivated to work in the game. Still, not the end of the world considering I have a full-time job too.
I went to Tokyo Game Show which was great. I also got corona but had almost no symptoms so no problem in that front. Still no idea on what to get ready for the Halloween update. I might separate the UI update from the Halloween update. Not too sure on that one. Depends on how long I take to complete the UI update.</p>

<p>Anyways, I’ll keep going!! Hopefully this UI updates boosts sales significantly.</p>

    <p><strong>GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>Still improving the UI. I’m happy with the equipment UI remake I made. The battle UI is giving me trouble because of the addition of backgrounds. Backgrounds are kinda disturbing the current contrast of the scenes. I struggled quite a bit to make the palette something that doesn’t fight too much with the UI, but I think I managed to find a good balance. There is still a long way to go to finish remaking the UI. I say this not because I know what those tasks are but because it looks bad right now. Another problem is that my artist is busy, so things are going slow in that front too. I can’t wait to have animations in the game though.</p>

<p>I think the next update might come during Halloween? And maybe be halloween themed. So I’m guessing the end of October? Not sure. That would probably give me enough time to remake the trailer. That’s whole other issue all together. Not sure if I should try to find a new person to make the trailer or use the same person as before. I’m not happy with the previous person but then I’m not sure if I can find someone much better either…</p>

<p>Next update:
A) Equipment screen update
B) Chapter 2 maybe. Chapter 3 maybe?
C) ???????????? Icons to the UI? Notifications on tabs? 
D) Cooking??
D) Offline progress (maybe?)</p>

<p>Not much progress on review count.

<p>Things have slowed down on the monster card game because I’m waiting for artists. So right now most of the the time in that project is related to interacting with artists instead of programming.</p>
