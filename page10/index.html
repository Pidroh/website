        December 1st Week: Polish+ and Rebalance!

    <span class="post-date">06 Dec 2021</span>

    <p>The game’s interface should look better and progress in the game should be faster. I have also tweaked a bunch of other things and added more bosses.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>22 hours programming, a bit down. The reason is the 16 hours of ‘designer’. I guess I was thinking about various aspects of the game? I don’t remember hahaha</p>

<p>I will now tackle elemental spells! Or maybe something else since elemental spells will require me to overhaul some parts of enemy generation.</p>

<p>Next week I’ll do a small surgery so I’ll work on the game more? Or maybe less? Who knows!</p>

        November 4th Week: Generic RPG Idle Skill Sets and Magic Points
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">29 Nov 2021</span>

    <p>This was a big change towards making the game more active (not sure on how well it worked though lol).
Now you have multiple sets of skill to choose from and you have to manually use skills during battle. You can defeat some bosses faster and stuff.</p>

<p><strong>BE WARNED</strong></p>

<p><strong>THE PROTOTYPE IS VERY SIMPLE AND BORING. YOU KINDA JUST LEAVE IT RUNNING IN THE BROWSE, CHOOSE YOUR EQUIPMENT AND WHERE TO FIGHT</strong></p>

<p>37 hours programming, it was productive too compared to last week. The 6 hours in manager and designer are trying to decide on how to handle the post game and how to add money to the game.</p>

        November 3rd Week: Generic RPG Idle item system revamp
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">22 Nov 2021</span>

    <p>I have changed how the item system works. Items now have names, different types, and different rarities. This allows for a higher range of play styles than before.</p>

<p>Lots of programming but a lot of it wasn’t so productive. I feel like I spent a lot of time rethinking things, having analysis paralysis and just play testing too much. But still, 36 hours making the game is nice.</p>

<p>Next update will take a while and will feature magic. It will change how the game is played quite a bit.</p>

        November 2st Week: Generic RPG Idle battle system entering the last phase
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">15 Nov 2021</span>

    <p>I have added a prestige system to Generic RPG to make the game a bit more dynamic. It plays well with the newly added bosses, I think.</p>

<p>I have finished the full specification for the RPG systems in Brave Ball! With this in hand, I now have the long road ahead of implementing all of those systems in Generic RPG Idle. I have also decided to do the map system in Haxe. A lot of development will be happening there, I want to develop it in an easier to prototype environment.</p>

<p>Less programming. 11 hours of me thinking and writing down the systems for Brave Ball! 23 hours for Generic RPG, not bad.</p>

        November 1st Week: Back to Brave Ball a bit
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">09 Nov 2021</span>

    <p>Added new bosses to the prototype!!! They give permanent stat upgrades. I did add further cutscenes to the game, but stopped myself from adding goals. The reason for that is because adding goals would make for a better game, I might not use it in Brave Ball. I might reconsider adding a similar system to Brave Ball though.</p>

<p>I also wrote all the cutscenes that will be in the Brave Ball demo! It was super fun.
Now I need to write code to integrate the cutscenes with the map. Not sure if I should write new map code in Haxe and do the integration in Haxe… Or move over to C# and do it there.</p>

2021-11 W:44 turn       : 12:28:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>26 hours programming the prototype and 12 hours planning and writing cutscenes for Brave Ball! Not bad!
Right now I’m adding a prestige system to HRPG, which might make it into Brave Ball. This Saturday I’ll make a decision on where to integrate the cutscenes to the map.</p>

<p>Let’s go!!!!!!!!</p>

  What is Brave Ball?
  </h1>
  Your weapon is a soccer ball. In an action RPG with turn-based mechanics.<br><br>

  If that sounds awesome to you like it does to me, <b>wishlist</b> the game to know when it comes out! <br><br>
  It increases the chances of the game being successful too, which means more updates! And more updates means a better game for everybody!
