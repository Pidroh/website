  <p><strong>GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>I finished up what one part of the addition to the new resource management system (Unknown tab). I also wrote all cutscenes of chapter 2, but only half of it is implemented in the early access release. I still need to integrate the rest of the cutscenes of chapter 2 in a later update. Right now I am changing the way I handle sprites in the game so I don’t have to add them manually to the game code. By automating this, it will be simpler to add new sprites and also simpler to add Spine animations to the game.</p>

<p>Spine will be my main animation tool for effects which is a departure because all my previous games that had a lot of effects (Daily Espada, Jobchanger Brigade, even my older games like Dragon Sky Rush) were all heavily dependant on particle systems. Hopefully this will mean more polished games? Hehehe, who knows. Which unfortunately means I am switching the focus from content to polishing, at least for a while. This is the first time I’m focusing on the appearance / marketability of the game. Since I’m creating a lot of systems from scratch, expanding my “engine” to have better integration with Spine is a good long-term investment.</p>

<p>So I think after early access, I’ll do a big update that will have:
A) lots of visual effects and sound effects lol possibly music
B) more Unknown tab content
C) chapter 2 story complete</p>

<p>There are also some small bugs that I need to investigate regarding noblesse and Mystic Elf, but I am afraid of updating the current Steam build and breaking things before the release, so I will fix them at a later date :( :(</p>

<p>I might also revamp the upgrade system but maybe I’ll leave that for a future update.

<p>Here is the time table for this week (week 27 of 2022):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2022 W:27 hrpg       : 19:08:00
2022 W:27 manager    :  0:37:00
2022 W:27 marketing  :  1:44:00
2022 W:27 hcontent   :  2:17:00
2022 W:27 designer   :  1:45:00
2022 W:27 monster    :  6:24:00
2022 W:27 hstory     :  1:30:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These hours are good, considering I was busy for my birthday yesterday. I am splitting content between hstory and hcontent, so around 3 hours is nice. The card game prototype (Monster) is not progressing as fast as I hoped. The drag-and-drop oriented UI changes a lot from how I was handling UI in Generic RPG Idle. But once I get through that it should move faster. I’m still limitting myself to 5 hours (it goes to 6 and half because I lose track of time, but I force myself to stop once I realize it). I don’t know if I’ll increase the time I spend on this side project or not.</p>

<p>Anyways, let’s keep going! TOMORROW IS THE STEAM RELEASE!!!!!!!!!!! (I think)</p>
