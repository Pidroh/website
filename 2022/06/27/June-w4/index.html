  <p>I have decided on a Steam release date for the game. Haven’t announced it yet because I’m not sure if I can make it D: but I think I can, unless some horrible problem comes up. This week I wrote some story for chapter 2 (I should have done this sooner). I wanted to release the Early Access version with the entirety of chapter 2, but I am not sure I can make it. Which means that early access might launch with half of chapter 2. I have two reasons for that:</p>

<p>1) I did some major rebalancing of the game’s Soul Crush system last week, to test that stuff I need some new simple dev tools
2) The game had some issues for people with big screens and I added that last week
3) The steam page still has screens and trailer from the last version. I might do something about this, not sure.</p>

<p>I decide to rebalance the game now because I want people to be able to import their saves. The rebalance means that advance people will lose their Soul Crush / Challenge Area progress. Figured it was better do that sooner than later.</p>

<p>You can try the game here: https://pidroh.github.io/GenericRPGIdle/</p>

<p>Here is the time table for this week (week 25 of 2022):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2022 W:25 manager    :  1:50:00
2022 W:25 marketing  :  1:58:00
2022 W:25 hrpg       : 24:09:00
2022 W:25 hstory     :  3:53:00
2022 W:25 design     :  1:08:00
2022 W:25 monster    :  5:58:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Those hours are nice. Anyways, me and my SO did break up but the relationship was decaying, so that was good in the long run, I believe. Anyways, this week I’ll continue making some debugging tools and make what content I can out of chapter 2. The Steam page overhaul might come later, on the first big update of the game.</p>

<p>It took a long time to release what was supposed to be a very small prototype for some game mechanics… I’m glad I did decide on a deadline for it, because the way I’m working in the game, I could keep developing the game forever. Let us keep going strong!</p>
