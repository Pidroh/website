        January Week 2 - GRI Beta is up!!
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">16 Jan 2023</span>

    <p><strong>CARD NOVA / GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>I have FINALLY finished the “Sound of Art” update for Generic RPG Idle, which adds sound to the game. This one required collaboration with multiple professionals to make happen. Good thing is my sound code is fairly stable now. That means I’ll have an easier time when doing sound for CARD NOVA!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj6t1ohP9g4">===&gt; NEW TRAILER &lt;===</a></p>

<p>I have a beta available for the new version of GRI, instructions are here:</p>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1858120/view/5281067109624265833">Beta instructions</a></p>

<p>Card Nova’s prototype is going well. I am considering sharing some WIP artwork, not sure.</p>

<hr />

<p>Here is the time table for week 2:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2023 W:02 monster    	 : 34:45:00
2023 W:02 manager    	 :  1:24:00
2023 W:02 hrpg       	 : 13:23:00
2023 W:02 monster_stream :  1:40:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I streamed! And I also measured it. It increases my concentration, so I am trying to stream development. I don’t really have a schedule right now, just do it periodically. I’ll try to expand the number of hours I stream weekly, if it feels sustainable I’ll consider deciding on a schedule.</p>

    <p><strong>CARD NOVA / GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>Hey, everyone! 
This week I finished up creating/polishing the music / sfx system for GRI. Then I fixed some weird bugs I found. Next I wanna do some QOL stuff that one user asked for. 
GRI for Switch is still not guaranteed.</p>

<p>For Card Nova, I am making a prototype and seeing how localization would work. Yeah, I wanna get localization working very early so that I can localize the game more freely. The very early prototype I have for the card game allows players to upgrade their cards and fight duels. It’s not exactly the most playable prototype, but it’s there. I’m currently seeing how to render Chinese characters and I think I found a nice font (if not too small).</p>

<p>Wishlist behavior for Card Nova has been very different from GRI. The game exploded. And then faded. Steam page reveal Wishlists for Card Nova were much higher than GRI. Even before press coverage. But after a couple of weeks, Wishlist count is lower than GRI. I’m not sure on what to think of this. 
My current theory is that my tag setup gives you a lot of Wishlists when your game is booming (“newly added page”, new trailer, etc) by showing it in popular game pages. But not so much when things are going slow. While Generic RPG Idle only shows up in other niche games, so even a slow week is a healthy week, kinda? I might retag Card Nova Hyper by rexamining what I should compete with.</p>

<hr />

<p>No time table for this week. End of the year always bugs my data and I don’t really wanna fix it. It was a good week though.
Hope 2023 is going great for everyone and gets even better.</p>

    <p><strong>CARD NOVA / GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>The launch of the Steam page for CARD NOVA HYPER has been going extremely well, having being covered by sites all across the globe.</p>

<p>And finally I got the assets I need for GRI. I’ll reveal the new trailer later! Currently implementing all the sounds and the music system. GRI is going steady. I want to fix a bloating problem with the save system that has been around for a long time, so that might take some time and possibly introduce bugs, which scare me. But gotta do it now.</p>

<p>I contacted Nintendo and I’m waiting for their reply…</p>

<hr />

<p>Here is the time table for this week and last week (week 51 of 2022):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2022 W:51 monster    : 27:01:00
2022 W:51 manager    :  0:52:00
2022 W:51 hrpg       : 16:46:00
2022 W:51 marketing  :  0:58:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Times have been great and progress on both games is going nicely. 2022 is about to end and I’m glad I got this far. I have had the goals of pitching the game to Nintendo and launching the Card game steam page for quite some time now, nice to see that I finally reached both stages. While CARD NOVA HYPER will only release in 2024, I have many plans for 2023. One of those should be GRI leaving early access next year. If the stars align, maybe GRI comes to Nintendo Switch in 2023? We will see!!</p>

<p>Next time I write one of those is gonna be 2024!</p>

        December 3rd week - Revealed new Steam Page!

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">19 Dec 2022</span>

    <p><strong>CARD NOVA / GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>I finally revealed the Steam page for Card Nova Hyper, the name of my deckbuilder RPG! 
https://store.steampowered.com/app/2197330/CARD_NOVA_HYPER/
The release date is set for 2024 and development is still in the early stages.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, hopefully I’ll be able to reveal the new trailer for Generic RPG Idle before the year ends!
Unfortunately, my recent contractors have delayed things multiple things, so I think it will be revealed in January. After that I think I’ll be up to more waiting when pitchting to Nintendo.</p>

<hr />

<p>Here is the time table for this week and last week (week 50 of 2022):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2022 W:50 hrpg       :  2:44:00
2022 W:50 battle     :  6:55:00
2022 W:50 monster    : 38:04:00
2022 W:50 manager    :  0:13:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I have spent a lot of time focusing on the card game (monster). All those delays related to GRI (Generic RPG Idle) are messing up my plans. I will have to take some time to replan how I want to proceed with GRI from now on, taking into account all the delays.</p>

        December 2nd week - Working and Waiting Part 3

    <span class="post-date">12 Dec 2022</span>

    <p><strong>GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>I got the sound effects! Am now waiting for music and press release writing.
I will probably pitch Generic RPG Idle to Nintendo on December or January. Hope they reply fast.</p>

<hr />

<p>Here is the time table for this week and last week (week 49 of 2022):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2022 W:49 engine     : 46:33:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I spent 46 hours just hacking away at the engine. I managed to greatly optimize my code, but it’s hard to use all of the optimized code in Generic RPG Idle. I do think that for the next GRI update performance should increase a fair bit. Not sure when that next update will be as I’m doing a lot of waiting for other people and my plans will change depending on Nintendo’s reply. The engine will be used on my future games.</p>

<p>Anyways, let’s keep going!</p>

  What is Brave Ball?

  Your weapon is a soccer ball. In an action RPG with turn-based mechanics.<br><br>

  If that sounds awesome to you like it does to me, <b>wishlist</b> the game to know when it comes out! <br><br>
  It increases the chances of the game being successful too, which means more updates! And more updates means a better game for everybody!
