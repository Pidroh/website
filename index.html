    <p>Just coding the new weapon practice system. Not much to add… Steam Next Fest starts in exactly two weeks! Maybe I’ll release the first version of the new weapon practice system then? Just make sure to say it is not complete. Not sure if it will be in a good state by then, but we’ll see.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The hours are much better than last week. Guess I had a good productive weekend to help boost that. But I did get burned out a bit and didn’t do anything Sunday night. Called my gradma back in Brazil… I’m such a terrible grandson though :( was supposed to call on her birthday but just kept postponing it… Felt guilty.</p>

    <p>Focused a bit more on polish and then went back to coding the weapon practice system. The system is starting to take shape. I’m now considering if I should update my Steam page before Steam Next Fest.</p>

<p>The hours are okay? Don’t know if something happened specifically. Anyways, guess I’ll keep going… Really unsure if I focus on the Steam page or just focus on getting more content into the game. :(</p>

    <p>I was going to add more polish to the demo but ended up coding a new system lol but I’ll reevaluate stuff to polish from tomorrow. I also tried posting a video devlog on the incremental sub reddit but that wasn’t such a good idea. The video is too boring if you don’t edit it and all.</p>

<p>The hours are nice. But the new system that I started coding is being a seed to stress. It’s one small system that is supposed to be part of a bigger system which also relates to the future games I can make. This makes me think about a thousand things. I’m a bit discouraged right now about the game and keep stressing myself out thinking about working on other games.</p>

    <p>I did release the new story this Friday, which I didn’t think would happen! So that is nice. Right now I’m adding equipment to support different types of builds (counter-attack, magic, extreme speed, extreme attack). This will add some build variation and complexity to the game. After that is done, I’ll try to introduce complexity a bit better by limiting what players can see at the start of the game. Right now very complex pieces of equipment can drop in the very first battle. While fun, that can be daunting. After that I think I’ll just polish the demo.</p>

<p>Same 30 hours as last week. Nothing to complain here. It was a big holiday in Japan though, this kinda shows that having more free time doesn’t necessarily result in more hours being put to good use. :( which is a bit sad.</p>

<p>Anyways, Steam Next Fest it is. Already sent the first build of the demo for review, but they are taking a while so the demo might have a problem in it… Hope not.</p>

    <p>I managed to fix the Steam save issues I was having!! Thank God!
This week I have been grinding away at all the problems of the new story cutscenes. And there are a lot of small problems… Maybe by next week I can get this new content out? Possibly not.</p>

<p>Got a nice amount of programming, but I skipped some other weekly tasks I have. I used to do a design re-evaluation every Saturday, but I’m thinking of changing when I do that. And besides, now that I’m focusing on content it feels less necessary…?</p>

<p>Just a month until Steam Next Fest D:</p>

  It increases the chances of the game being successful too, which means more updates! And more updates means a better game for everybody!
