        November 1st week - Halloween released!
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Nov 2022</span>

    <p><strong>GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>I released the halloween update. I didn’t advertise the event because I’m trying to focus more on long-term goals (getting the new GRI update going and start planning the next update) than short-term ones (making extra money). I’m thinking there might be only 1~3 updates until launch. I mean 1 update =&gt; final update for release.</p>

<p>Next update:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sounds and music, new animations and effects</li>
  <li>MAYBE: more unknown tab content</li>
</ul>

<p>The polish criteria is still this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How easily reusable is this improvement for other projects?</li>
  <li>How fast can I make it?</li>
  <li>Do I have a good reference to use when making the polish?</li>
  <li>Does the polish look good on trailers?</li>
  <li>Does the polish make the game easier to understand?
    <ul>
      <li>makes it easier for people who just started to understand the game</li>
      <li>visualized that actions happened</li>
      <li>how actions actually work</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How often will new players see this polish?</li>
  <li>how often will long-term players see this polish?</li>
  <li>Is the polish making the game prettier but less enjoyable to play somehow?</li>
</ul>

<p>But I found a sound guy and want to get it done.
So I don’t think I’ll be adding any additional effects other than what I have planned. Might enhance what is already there though. Maybe that’s more of sequel material though.

<p>Here is the time table for this week and last week (week 44 of 2022):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2022 W:44 hrpg       : 21:15:00
2022 W:44 manager    :  1:08:00

2022 W:44 designer   :  0:16:00
2022 W:44 housework  :  0:19:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Productivity is okay but I have been playing Loop Hero which is a big time drain. It gave me some ideas about game structure (game has some nice game structure ideas though nothing ideal) but I don’t want to explore that direction too much right now. The monster project which is progressing nicely and I might have something to show for it in December!</p>

<p>I also made a website lol a bit sooner than what I expected but it’s there. I’ll probably change the discord channel name to suit the new developer name I’ll be using. (Finally retiring “Pidroh”).</p>

<p>Best in life to all!</p>

<p>The halloweeen content is ready to be published! I’ll do it tonight I think, just to be sure.</p>

<p>Next update:
A) Boss, skills and equipment mods (related to blood mechanics)</p>

<p>I decided to not put in music yet. I need to polish things up and make sure I’m not making anything annoying. I might wait until I have sound effects to put music in. And to make sound effects, I want to have a final version of what the game will play like. So I’m now trying to decide on how much I’ll prettify and animate the game. This is a hard decision for me because I don’t want to spend a long time doing this. So I’ll try to be very selective about what I polish. I guess the criteria should be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How easily reusable is this improvement for other projects?</li>
  <li>How fast can I make it?</li>
  <li>Do I have a good reference to use when making the polish?</li>
  <li>Does the polish look good on trailers?</li>
  <li>Does the polish make the game easier to understand?

<p>Productivity is down. Lately Netflix has been getting to me. And thinking about polishing Generic RPG Idle is a bit discouraging because it’s hard to make decisions. I don’t like some things about how the game looks right now and I want to fix it by remaking everything in pixel art which I absolutely WILL NOT do. Only for a complete sequel / spiritual successor. So things are a bit discouraging.</p>

        October 3rd week - Halloween? And music

    <p><strong>GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>The graphics update launched. Natural sales from Steam aren’t getting boosted as much as I thought. Maybe it didn’t change anything which is interesting. I’m a bit relieved it didn’t somehow make the game perform worse. Of course the data I have isn’t “scientific” so I’m speculating on small data, but never the less, it did not make any significant change in revenue for better or for worse for natural Steam traffic.</p>

<p>But I guess Reddit comments are getting boosted…? Maybe…? Maybe not.</p>

<p>This is all a bit surprising. Perhaps I should stick to minimalistic games and focus more on better systems instead of pixel art. Then once I arrive at something I love, I can create a bigger budget game and go full power. Food for thought.</p>

<p>I am preparing some halloween content. And also music.</p>

<p>Next update:
A) Halloween content
B) Music maybe</p>

<p>Here is the time table for this week and last week (week 41 of 2022):</p>

<p>Productivity is still nice. I’m back to allocating time to the card game which is plenty of fun to think about too. But it’s getting a bit blocked by company documents.</p>

        October 2nd week - Remaking the UI V 
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Oct 2022</span>

    <p><strong>GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>I released a small beta for the changes. I got some nice feedback and made some adjustments. Things SEEM fine. No bugs coming up yet.</p>

<p>Next update:
A) Equipment screen update
B) Battle screen update
C) Chapter 2
D) QOL</p>

<p>The boost from 10 reviews was dying but then I posted the game on feedback friday asking for feedback on the beta. Some folks ignored the beta instructions part and just bought the game straight away. I think the (positive) label is also improving quality of when I post the game for people to see. People know the game isn’t broken because of the positive reviews and all. This is just a theory, but since conversion rate is probably increased, every person I send to Steam is a high quality visit which makes Steam want to promote the page a little bit. And since conversion rate is also up when Steam promotes the page, the boost is bigger. What I want to say is that the 10 reviews thing really creates a cummulative positive effect for everything you do Steam related.

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>PRODUCTIVITY IS BACK BABY! Didn’t even notice it. I think it’s because I got pretty engaged in finish up the update. Also I finished a big part of the documents of registering the company. It already exists and all. After I get the tax information set up I’ll transfer my Steam games to the company.</p>

<p>Goooooooooooo!</p>

  What is Brave Ball?
  </h1>
  Your weapon is a soccer ball. In an action RPG with turn-based mechanics.<br><br>

  If that sounds awesome to you like it does to me, <b>wishlist</b> the game to know when it comes out! <br><br>
  It increases the chances of the game being successful too, which means more updates! And more updates means a better game for everybody!
