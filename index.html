        January 4th Week - R&D Week!
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">24 Jan 2022</span>

    <p>So last week we pushed a big update on Steam. This week, though… I have recently discovered that using Haxe UI for a console release would be a bit shaky. So I decided to:</p>

<p>A) Create my own highly portable UI system
B) port generic RPG to that</p>

<p>And things have been messy.</p>

<hr />
<hr />

<p>Here is the time table for this week (week 3 of 2022):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2022 W:03 hrpg       :  37:21:00
2022 W:03 housework  :  0:59:00
2022 W:03 marketing  :  3:52:00
2022 W:03 manager    :  5:28:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So I got 37 hours in on GRI. It’s pretty easy to get a lot of hours in when you’re trying to implement a basic rendering engine and I keep moving between libraries. My concentration goes up the roof lol. Currently, I went from:</p>

<p>Haxe UI =&gt; Pure KHA =&gt; Haxe JS Canvas =&gt; Haxe Phaser.js</p>

<p>Haxe Phaser.js does seem to be the best option for targetting browsers, so I guess I’ll keep going with that. Hope I don’t hit any roadblocks :(</p>

    <p>Big update on the UI and the Steam page is up!!</p>

<p>You can try the game here: https://pidroh.github.io/GenericRPGIdle/</p>

<p>A lot of hover information, turn-order visualization, and other goodies came with the new UI.</p>

<p>Here is the time table for this week (week 2 of 2022):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2022 W:02 hrpg       :  25:26:00
2022 W:02 manager    :  2:39:00
2022 W:02 marketing  :  1:07:00
2022 W:02 designer   :  6:04:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Got 25 hours in generic rpg idle. A lot less than last week. This weekend I was pretty busy so I guess that is the reason. I was planning to port GRI to consoles, but that idea went north as I found out that the Haxe UI ecosystem isn’t that robust. Trying to figure out what I want to aim for in this year. Having trouble.</p>

<p>We’ll see how it goes!</p>

    <p>Things are the same as last week! Still working hard on the new update for the game that will change the UI and the looks of the game big time. 
While I’m getting that ready, there aren’t any updates in the game for now.</p>

<p>Got 34 hours in. I’m almost done with the new version. Should be coming next week. Where I live is getting pretty cold, hope everyone is safe during these times.</p>

<p>It’s a bit confusing but I guess I got 25 hours in of working on Generic RPG Idle. Not bad.</p>

<p>I plan to finish the artwork rework soon. The problem is that it will come with a bunch of broken stuff that will need fixing. Maybe the next build will only come in two weeks.</p>

<p>HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time working on a new build system to handle the multiple versions of the game. It’s in multiple sites now. I have also spent way too much time thinking about the graphics of the game. I’ll have to rethink everything going forward with the game when I add more cutscenes to the game.</p>

  What is Brave Ball?

  Your weapon is a soccer ball. In an action RPG with turn-based mechanics.<br><br>

  If that sounds awesome to you like it does to me, <b>wishlist</b> the game to know when it comes out! <br><br>
  It increases the chances of the game being successful too, which means more updates! And more updates means a better game for everybody!
