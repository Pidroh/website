  <p><strong>CARD NOVA / GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>Hey, everyone! 
This week I finished up creating/polishing the music / sfx system for GRI. Then I fixed some weird bugs I found. Next I wanna do some QOL stuff that one user asked for. 
GRI for Switch is still not guaranteed.</p>

<p>For Card Nova, I am making a prototype and seeing how localization would work. Yeah, I wanna get localization working very early so that I can localize the game more freely. The very early prototype I have for the card game allows players to upgrade their cards and fight duels. It’s not exactly the most playable prototype, but it’s there. I’m currently seeing how to render Chinese characters and I think I found a nice font (if not too small).</p>

<p>Wishlist behavior for Card Nova has been very different from GRI. The game exploded. And then faded. Steam page reveal Wishlists for Card Nova were much higher than GRI. Even before press coverage. But after a couple of weeks, Wishlist count is lower than GRI. I’m not sure on what to think of this. 
My current theory is that my tag setup gives you a lot of Wishlists when your game is booming (“newly added page”, new trailer, etc) by showing it in popular game pages. But not so much when things are going slow. While Generic RPG Idle only shows up in other niche games, so even a slow week is a healthy week, kinda? I might retag Card Nova Hyper by rexamining what I should compete with.</p>

<hr />

<p>No time table for this week. End of the year always bugs my data and I don’t really wanna fix it. It was a good week though.
Hope 2023 is going great for everyone and gets even better.</p>
