        September 3rd week - Remaking the UI II 
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">22 Sep 2022</span>

    <p><strong>GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>The battle UI is still going, slowly. The game is slowly coming into shape. The story is giving me trouble because there are a lot of stages and the backgrounds have to be set manually. The new animations for the main character should be coming in later this week. No idea if I’ll make a new trailer or not. Sound effects will probably come at a different update so maybe I should wait for sound effects before updating the trailer? Or just create a quick 15 second trailer myself? I don’t know what to do. The look of the game is going to change a lot but I don’t really want to do two trailers. Might not have a choice though.</p>

<p>Next update:
A) Equipment screen update
B) Battle screen update
B) Chapter 2 maybe. Chapter 3 maybe?
C) ???????????? Icons to the UI? Notifications on tabs? 
D) Cooking??
D) Offline progress (maybe?)</p>

<p>I am now at 8 reviews! Only two more people to get to 10!

<p>Productivity went down last week. Lately I have been hooked in a show called Ozark and I haven’t been so motivated to work in the game. Still, not the end of the world considering I have a full-time job too.
I went to Tokyo Game Show which was great. I also got corona but had almost no symptoms so no problem in that front. Still no idea on what to get ready for the Halloween update. I might separate the UI update from the Halloween update. Not too sure on that one. Depends on how long I take to complete the UI update.</p>

<p>Anyways, I’ll keep going!! Hopefully this UI updates boosts sales significantly.</p>

        September 2nd week - Remaking the UI 
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Sep 2022</span>

    <p><strong>GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>Still improving the UI. I’m happy with the equipment UI remake I made. The battle UI is giving me trouble because of the addition of backgrounds. Backgrounds are kinda disturbing the current contrast of the scenes. I struggled quite a bit to make the palette something that doesn’t fight too much with the UI, but I think I managed to find a good balance. There is still a long way to go to finish remaking the UI. I say this not because I know what those tasks are but because it looks bad right now. Another problem is that my artist is busy, so things are going slow in that front too. I can’t wait to have animations in the game though.</p>

<p>I think the next update might come during Halloween? And maybe be halloween themed. So I’m guessing the end of October? Not sure. That would probably give me enough time to remake the trailer. That’s whole other issue all together. Not sure if I should try to find a new person to make the trailer or use the same person as before. I’m not happy with the previous person but then I’m not sure if I can find someone much better either…</p>

<p>Next update:
A) Equipment screen update
B) Chapter 2 maybe. Chapter 3 maybe?
C) ???????????? Icons to the UI? Notifications on tabs? 
D) Cooking??
D) Offline progress (maybe?)</p>

<p>Not much progress on review count.

<p>Things have slowed down on the monster card game because I’m waiting for artists. So right now most of the the time in that project is related to interacting with artists instead of programming.</p>

        September 1st week - After the update...?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">02 Sep 2022</span>

    <p><strong>GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>I’m getting closer to 10 reviews but still far. Lately I have decided to improve the UI of the game. More like a complete remake of what the game looks like right now hahahaha. I want to remake mainly the equipment screen and the battle screen. I don’t know how the update of the battle screen is gonna go though.  There are too many weapons and paying a artist to animate all the weapons and skills would be complicated. I’m still thinking through this. Wish I could do a kickstarter, but a kickstarter for an idle game is something I have never heard of before. Maybe I should be a pioneer?</p>

<p>Next update:
A) Equipment screen update
B) Chapter 2 maybe. Chapter 3 maybe?
C) ???????????? Icons to the UI? Notifications on tabs? 
D) Cooking??
D) Offline progress (maybe?)</p>

<p>I should be done remaking the equipment UI fairly soon. Then I need to stop and decide on what to do next. I really want to do notification on tabs and other QOL stuff. I feel like that should be done before I move on to remaking the battle graphics. I’m giving a wild guess here, but I think Generic RPG Idle should stay in early access for around four to six months? So I can really improve the experience before launch. Honestly I wasn’t expecting to develop for so long. If I somehow manage to remake the battle screen BEFORE 2022 ends, I will try to pitch the game to Nintendo. Hopefully by then I will have 10 reviews?</p>

        August 4th Week - Rituals and Magic released!!
      </a>

    <span class="post-date">25 Aug 2022</span>

    <p><strong>GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>I released the content update and the game is up for sale. I’m still really far from 10 reviews. I’m a bit lost on what I’m going to do next. I need to think about the second major update to the game. Also need to figure out if I want to translate the game or not. I think I want to have Chinese, Japanese and German support for sure.</p>

<p>Next update:
A) sound effects lol possibly music
B) Chapter 2 maybe. Chapter 3 maybe?
C) ???????????? Icons to the UI? Notifications on tabs? Actual animations during battle?
D) Cooking??
D) Offline progress (maybe?)</p>

<p>I haven’t really double checked those times not sure if they are correct. We’ll see how it goes. The card game prototype is advancing in the shadows. I have burned a lot of money on artists already for that game lol</p>

    <span class="post-date">15 Aug 2022</span>

    <p><strong>GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>I am done with the update content. I’ll update the beta builds to try and catch more bugs and get going with the browser beta on Reddit. Maybe I can release the update next week? I don’t know. I’m also preparing a new trailer for the game. Last week was a bit stressful, as releases / updates usually are. But we’ll see how it goes. Hopefully the update goes well. I still need to update a bunch of stuff on the Steam page for it though</p>

<p>Update 1 should have:
A) Everything included in the beta right now unless I am forced to remove something
B) A little more arcania
C) A little more exploration
D) New items and skills</p>

<p>While update 2 MIGHT have:
A) Visual effects and sound effects lol possibly music
B) Chapter 2 maybe
C) Offline progress (maybe maybe)</p>

<p>Today was my most “productive” week, but I’m pretty burned out. I want to release this update and take a mental rest. Not sure if I’ll actually do that though… Lol. Oh well. Let’s keep going! Just a bit more until I can release this!</p>

  What is Brave Ball?

  Your weapon is a soccer ball. In an action RPG with turn-based mechanics.<br><br>

  If that sounds awesome to you like it does to me, <b>wishlist</b> the game to know when it comes out! <br><br>
  It increases the chances of the game being successful too, which means more updates! And more updates means a better game for everybody!
