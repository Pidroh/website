        December 3rd week - Revealed new Steam Page!
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">19 Dec 2022</span>

    <p><strong>CARD NOVA / GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>I finally revealed the Steam page for Card Nova Hyper, the name of my deckbuilder RPG! 
https://store.steampowered.com/app/2197330/CARD_NOVA_HYPER/
The release date is set for 2024 and development is still in the early stages.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, hopefully I’ll be able to reveal the new trailer for Generic RPG Idle before the year ends!
Unfortunately, my recent contractors have delayed things multiple things, so I think it will be revealed in January. After that I think I’ll be up to more waiting when pitchting to Nintendo.</p>

<hr />

<p>Here is the time table for this week and last week (week 50 of 2022):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2022 W:50 hrpg       :  2:44:00
2022 W:50 battle     :  6:55:00
2022 W:50 monster    : 38:04:00
2022 W:50 manager    :  0:13:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I have spent a lot of time focusing on the card game (monster). All those delays related to GRI (Generic RPG Idle) are messing up my plans. I will have to take some time to replan how I want to proceed with GRI from now on, taking into account all the delays.</p>

        December 2nd week - Working and Waiting Part 3

    <span class="post-date">12 Dec 2022</span>

    <p><strong>GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>I got the sound effects! Am now waiting for music and press release writing.
I will probably pitch Generic RPG Idle to Nintendo on December or January. Hope they reply fast.</p>

<hr />

<p>Here is the time table for this week and last week (week 49 of 2022):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2022 W:49 engine     : 46:33:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I spent 46 hours just hacking away at the engine. I managed to greatly optimize my code, but it’s hard to use all of the optimized code in Generic RPG Idle. I do think that for the next GRI update performance should increase a fair bit. Not sure when that next update will be as I’m doing a lot of waiting for other people and my plans will change depending on Nintendo’s reply. The engine will be used on my future games.</p>

<p>Anyways, let’s keep going!</p>

    <p><strong>GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>Still waiting for the sound effects… [2]
This week, as a preparation for the future, I have started to see how I can optimize my engine.
I have optimized some stuff on GRI (and broke other things in the process…), so FPS in the next build should hopefully be a bit higher.</p>

<hr />

<p>Here is the time table for this week and last week (week 48 of 2022):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2022 W:48 gamejam    :  2:22:00
2022 W:48 manager    :  0:23:00
2022 W:48 hrpg       : 33:14:00
2022 W:48 monster    : 18:50:00
2022 W:48 feedback   :  0:00:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Productivity was very nice. Mainly because trying to optimize the rendering engine is really engaging. It’s really addictive to try to do it.</p>

<p>Let’s goo!</p>

    <p><strong>GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>Still waiting for the sound effects… Also waiting for an animation for the card game.
I also took some time to work on a game jam! I couldn’t actually submit (first time in my life that I enter in a gamejam and don’t submit). The main reason is because I wanted to implement a very specific battle system and prioritized that more than the game jam. I didn’t even finish the game logic.</p>

<p>Next GRI update:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sounds and music, new animations and effects</li>
  <li>MAYBE: more unknown tab content</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Here is the time table for this week and last week (week 47 of 2022):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2022 W:47 monster    :  4:59:00
2022 W:47 manager    :  2:09:00
2022 W:47 hrpg       : 21:50:00
2022 W:47 study      :  4:27:00
2022 W:47 gamejam    : 13:27:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Productivity was nice.
For a couple of the next weeks, I think the time I use on GRI (hrpg) will become a bit lower. I am currently preparing to send the game to Nintendo and I’ll wait a bit for their response.</p>

<p>Let’s goo!</p>

<p>The sound guy is working on the game and it is taking time.
Meanwhile, I just do some small fixes and additions in Generic RPG Idle.
As for the card game, I spent the whole weekend preparing the base material for an animation. It was a bit crazy.</p>

<p>Next GRI update:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sounds and music, new animations and effects</li>
  <li>MAYBE: more unknown tab content</li>

2022 W:46 study      :  0:20:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Productivity didn’t change much from last week. Spent less time studying and more time pixeling. It was the first time I spend over 10 hours on Aseprite. Hopefully it pays off soon.</p>

<p>Best in life to all!</p>
