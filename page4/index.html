        August 4th Week - Rituals and Magic released!!

    <p><strong>GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>I released the content update and the game is up for sale. I’m still really far from 10 reviews. I’m a bit lost on what I’m going to do next. I need to think about the second major update to the game. Also need to figure out if I want to translate the game or not. I think I want to have Chinese, Japanese and German support for sure.</p>

<p>Next update:
A) sound effects lol possibly music
B) Chapter 2 maybe. Chapter 3 maybe?
C) ???????????? Icons to the UI? Notifications on tabs? Actual animations during battle?
D) Cooking??
D) Offline progress (maybe?)</p>

<hr />

<p>Here is the time table for this week (week 33 of 2022):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2022 W:33 hrpg       : 32:24:00
2022 W:33 monster    :  9:12:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I haven’t really double checked those times not sure if they are correct. We’ll see how it goes. The card game prototype is advancing in the shadows. I have burned a lot of money on artists already for that game lol</p>

        August 3rd Week - Preparing the Update IV
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">15 Aug 2022</span>

    <p><strong>GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>I am done with the update content. I’ll update the beta builds to try and catch more bugs and get going with the browser beta on Reddit. Maybe I can release the update next week? I don’t know. I’m also preparing a new trailer for the game. Last week was a bit stressful, as releases / updates usually are. But we’ll see how it goes. Hopefully the update goes well. I still need to update a bunch of stuff on the Steam page for it though</p>

<p>Update 1 should have:
A) Everything included in the beta right now unless I am forced to remove something
B) A little more arcania
C) A little more exploration
D) New items and skills</p>

<p>While update 2 MIGHT have:
A) Visual effects and sound effects lol possibly music
B) Chapter 2 maybe
C) Offline progress (maybe maybe)</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Today was my most “productive” week, but I’m pretty burned out. I want to release this update and take a mental rest. Not sure if I’ll actually do that though… Lol. Oh well. Let’s keep going! Just a bit more until I can release this!</p>

        August 2nd Week - Preparing the Update III
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">09 Aug 2022</span>

    <p><strong>GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>After adding a bunch of content to the Unknown tab and adding the exploration mode for Lu (old name You), I decided to run a beta test. This is mainly because I’m worried about how players will receive the new system. The beta has been running for a while but nobody has said anything. Maybe the new exploration system doesn’t really make much of a difference? I don’t know.</p>

<p>Update 1 should have:
A) Everything included in the beta unless I am forced to remove something
B) A little more arcania
C) A little more exploration
D) New items and skills (maybe)</p>

<p>While update 2 MIGHT have:
A) Visual effects and sound effects lol possibly music
B) Chapter 2 maybe
C) Offline progress (maybe maybe)</p>

<p>Here is the time table for this week (week 31 of 2022):</p>

2022 W:31 monster    : 16:24:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I ended up not recording game designer tasks separately so a lot of thinking stuff ended up going into GRI development (hrpg), alongside getting ready for the beta and etc. As for monster, the card game, most of the time there was spent looking through artist submissions and giving instructions to the artist I plan to work with. The artist is not for card / monster design, but for character design. Let’s see how that project goes.</p>

    <span class="post-date">01 Aug 2022</span>

    <p><strong>GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>Today was a hard week that paid off. So I decided to change directions, like I said last week. At first the new system was feeling kinda boring. I felt discouraged and my mind started thinking of other things. But I just kept adding stuff to the system, adjusting and fixing the problems. It is not perfect, but I feel like I managed to breakthrough the problems I was seeing. I still need to tweak and adjust more, but it’s going well I believe.</p>

<p>Update 1 might have:
A) Visual effects
B) New exploration system
C) more Unknown tab content
D) Improved selling (maybe)
E) New items and skills (maybe)</p>

<p>There isn’t a lot of time so I’m not sure on how much I can include :( I do want to include improved selling even if the simplest possibility (automatically selling non-magic items)</p>

<p>While update 2 MIGHT have:
A) Visual effects and sound effects lol possibly music
B) Chapter 2 maybe
C) Offline progress and XP cap removal (maybe maybe)</p>

<p>Here is the time table for this week (week 30 of 2022):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2022 W:30 hrpg       : 32:42:00
2022 W:30 manager    :  1:08:00
2022 W:30 marketing  :  0:43:00
2022 W:30 designer   :  0:15:00
2022 W:30 burocracy  :  0:05:00
2022 W:30 monster    : 11:51:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Those hours are a bit too good so I think I must have messed up the recording of them. Not sure, I did double check. About play testing the monster card game, there are appears to be some nice services for that. Found this one: https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/wb3kb7/found_a_really_great_platform_to_get_feedback_on/ I probably can’t use that one early on since it is only for polished vertical slices, but still. I guess I’ll find a way to get nice amounts of play testing somehow.</p>

        July 4th Week - Preparing the Update
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">25 Jul 2022</span>

    <p><strong>GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>I decided to change directions. I decided on deprioritizing the story. So I won’t work on the story much until I can improve some of the things I’m not happy about in the game. Isabel’s story is a very small part of the GRI experience and You’s gameplay (I’m thinking of changing the name to Yuu) is pretty much the main meat of the game. I want to prioritize that first. I think that will result in a more engaging game and lay the fundation for improving both active gameplay and idle gameplay.</p>

<p>Right now I think that update 1 MIGHT have:
A) Visual effects
B) New exploration system
C) more Unknown tab content
D) Improved selling (maybe)
E) New items and skills (maybe)</p>

<p>While update 2 MIGHT have:
A) Visual effects and sound effects lol possibly music
B) Chapter 2 maybe
C) Offline progress and XP cap removal (maybe maybe)</p>

<p>Here is the time table for this week (week 28 of 2022):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2022 W:29 hrpg       : 23:58:00
2022 W:29 manager    :  5:37:00
2022 W:29 marketing  :  0:19:00
2022 W:29 hstory     :  0:01:00
2022 W:29 designer   :  2:24:00
2022 W:29 monster    :  9:10:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Nice hours. I decided to increase the time I spend on the monster card game to around 8 hours. After adding very basic enemy behavior, the card game is ALMOST playable but full of bugs. Maybe I can get something playable in a week or two? Looking forward to that.</p>

<p>It doesn’t have idle elements so I’m unsure on how I will get players at an early stage. I was thinking about keeping playtests private until the game is more polished. We will see.</p>
