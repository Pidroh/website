    <p>I did release the new story this Friday, which I didn’t think would happen! So that is nice. Right now I’m adding equipment to support different types of builds (counter-attack, magic, extreme speed, extreme attack). This will add some build variation and complexity to the game. After that is done, I’ll try to introduce complexity a bit better by limiting what players can see at the start of the game. Right now very complex pieces of equipment can drop in the very first battle. While fun, that can be daunting. After that I think I’ll just polish the demo.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Same 30 hours as last week. Nothing to complain here. It was a big holiday in Japan though, this kinda shows that having more free time doesn’t necessarily result in more hours being put to good use. :( which is a bit sad.</p>

<p>Anyways, Steam Next Fest it is. Already sent the first build of the demo for review, but they are taking a while so the demo might have a problem in it… Hope not.</p>

    <p>I managed to fix the Steam save issues I was having!! Thank God!
This week I have been grinding away at all the problems of the new story cutscenes. And there are a lot of small problems… Maybe by next week I can get this new content out? Possibly not.</p>

<p>Got a nice amount of programming, but I skipped some other weekly tasks I have. I used to do a design re-evaluation every Saturday, but I’m thinking of changing when I do that. And besides, now that I’m focusing on content it feels less necessary…?</p>

<p>Just a month until Steam Next Fest D:</p>

    <p>Got some Steam feedback and already fixed it. Then found that saves are getting broken lol. And struggling to fix it. I added set support so I should have the foundation for the new content. I have also written 11 new cutscenes for the game. Still haven’t added them though.</p>

    <p>Launched the playtest on Steam! Added animations to the game, revamped the UI, redid a bunch of UI stuff. The game should look and feel better.</p>

<p>This week was remarkably better than the last on. Nothing in particular to comment on. I am now adding back ‘equipment set’ support. This will be important in adding more content to the game as players will need to use different builds. Right now optimizing speed and using pierce spells is the dominant strategy, which I want to diversify from before the early access release.</p>

<p>This week… Was bad. My worst week in a long time lol. I guess the weekend wasn’t productive at all. And the week days also were not the best. I want to improve that by getting by sleep schedule in good pace.</p>

<p>Right now I’m redoing some stuff on the UI after some complaints. Things hopefully will look and feel better.</p>

  What is Brave Ball?
  </h1>
  Your weapon is a soccer ball. In an action RPG with turn-based mechanics.<br><br>

  If that sounds awesome to you like it does to me, <b>wishlist</b> the game to know when it comes out! <br><br>
  It increases the chances of the game being successful too, which means more updates! And more updates means a better game for everybody!
