    <p><strong>GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>The graphics update launched. Natural sales from Steam aren’t getting boosted as much as I thought. Maybe it didn’t change anything which is interesting. I’m a bit relieved it didn’t somehow make the game perform worse. Of course the data I have isn’t “scientific” so I’m speculating on small data, but never the less, it did not make any significant change in revenue for better or for worse for natural Steam traffic.</p>

<p>But I guess Reddit comments are getting boosted…? Maybe…? Maybe not.</p>

<p>This is all a bit surprising. Perhaps I should stick to minimalistic games and focus more on better systems instead of pixel art. Then once I arrive at something I love, I can create a bigger budget game and go full power. Food for thought.</p>

<p>I am preparing some halloween content. And also music.</p>

<p>Next update:
A) Halloween content
B) Music maybe</p>

<p>Here is the time table for this week and last week (week 41 of 2022):</p>

2022 W:41 company    : 10:33:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Productivity is still nice. I’m back to allocating time to the card game which is plenty of fun to think about too. But it’s getting a bit blocked by company documents.</p>

    <span class="post-date">10 Oct 2022</span>

    <p><strong>GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>I released a small beta for the changes. I got some nice feedback and made some adjustments. Things SEEM fine. No bugs coming up yet.</p>

<p>Next update:
A) Equipment screen update
B) Battle screen update
C) Chapter 2
D) QOL</p>

<p>The boost from 10 reviews was dying but then I posted the game on feedback friday asking for feedback on the beta. Some folks ignored the beta instructions part and just bought the game straight away. I think the (positive) label is also improving quality of when I post the game for people to see. People know the game isn’t broken because of the positive reviews and all. This is just a theory, but since conversion rate is probably increased, every person I send to Steam is a high quality visit which makes Steam want to promote the page a little bit. And since conversion rate is also up when Steam promotes the page, the boost is bigger. What I want to say is that the 10 reviews thing really creates a cummulative positive effect for everything you do Steam related.

<p>PRODUCTIVITY IS BACK BABY! Didn’t even notice it. I think it’s because I got pretty engaged in finish up the update. Also I finished a big part of the documents of registering the company. It already exists and all. After I get the tax information set up I’ll transfer my Steam games to the company.</p>

<p>Goooooooooooo!</p>

B) Chapter 2 maybe. Chapter 3 maybe?
C) ???????????? Icons to the UI? Notifications on tabs?  (partially)

<p>The battle UI is almost done. There are just some small features and animations that need to be redone. I’m starting to get excited about this. The game just feels different. Can’t wait to get this to players.</p>

<p>I am now at 8 reviews! Only two more people to get to 10!

<p>Productivity is still a bit down lately. Wonder why. Still, I have a full time job… Maybe my productivity was just too high before?</p>

    <span class="post-date">22 Sep 2022</span>

    <p><strong>GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>The battle UI is still going, slowly. The game is slowly coming into shape. The story is giving me trouble because there are a lot of stages and the backgrounds have to be set manually. The new animations for the main character should be coming in later this week. No idea if I’ll make a new trailer or not. Sound effects will probably come at a different update so maybe I should wait for sound effects before updating the trailer? Or just create a quick 15 second trailer myself? I don’t know what to do. The look of the game is going to change a lot but I don’t really want to do two trailers. Might not have a choice though.</p>

A) Equipment screen update

C) ???????????? Icons to the UI? Notifications on tabs?

<p>Productivity went down last week. Lately I have been hooked in a show called Ozark and I haven’t been so motivated to work in the game. Still, not the end of the world considering I have a full-time job too.
I went to Tokyo Game Show which was great. I also got corona but had almost no symptoms so no problem in that front. Still no idea on what to get ready for the Halloween update. I might separate the UI update from the Halloween update. Not too sure on that one. Depends on how long I take to complete the UI update.</p>

<p>Anyways, I’ll keep going!! Hopefully this UI updates boosts sales significantly.</p>
