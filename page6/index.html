        July 2nd Week - Getting ready for Early Access release (3)
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">11 Jul 2022</span>

    <p><strong>GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>I finished up what one part of the addition to the new resource management system (Unknown tab). I also wrote all cutscenes of chapter 2, but only half of it is implemented in the early access release. I still need to integrate the rest of the cutscenes of chapter 2 in a later update. Right now I am changing the way I handle sprites in the game so I don’t have to add them manually to the game code. By automating this, it will be simpler to add new sprites and also simpler to add Spine animations to the game.</p>

<p>Spine will be my main animation tool for effects which is a departure because all my previous games that had a lot of effects (Daily Espada, Jobchanger Brigade, even my older games like Dragon Sky Rush) were all heavily dependant on particle systems. Hopefully this will mean more polished games? Hehehe, who knows. Which unfortunately means I am switching the focus from content to polishing, at least for a while. This is the first time I’m focusing on the appearance / marketability of the game. Since I’m creating a lot of systems from scratch, expanding my “engine” to have better integration with Spine is a good long-term investment.</p>

<p>So I think after early access, I’ll do a big update that will have:
A) lots of visual effects and sound effects lol possibly music
B) more Unknown tab content
C) chapter 2 story complete</p>

<p>There are also some small bugs that I need to investigate regarding noblesse and Mystic Elf, but I am afraid of updating the current Steam build and breaking things before the release, so I will fix them at a later date :( :(</p>

<p>I might also revamp the upgrade system but maybe I’ll leave that for a future update.

<p>Here is the time table for this week (week 27 of 2022):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2022 W:27 hrpg       : 19:08:00
2022 W:27 manager    :  0:37:00
2022 W:27 marketing  :  1:44:00
2022 W:27 hcontent   :  2:17:00
2022 W:27 designer   :  1:45:00
2022 W:27 monster    :  6:24:00
2022 W:27 hstory     :  1:30:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These hours are good, considering I was busy for my birthday yesterday. I am splitting content between hstory and hcontent, so around 3 hours is nice. The card game prototype (Monster) is not progressing as fast as I hoped. The drag-and-drop oriented UI changes a lot from how I was handling UI in Generic RPG Idle. But once I get through that it should move faster. I’m still limitting myself to 5 hours (it goes to 6 and half because I lose track of time, but I force myself to stop once I realize it). I don’t know if I’ll increase the time I spend on this side project or not.</p>

<p>Anyways, let’s keep going! TOMORROW IS THE STEAM RELEASE!!!!!!!!!!! (I think)</p>

    <p>I am currently expanding more on the new resource management system. I think I’ll release the Early Access version next 12 of July. Two days after my birthday lol. I do feel a bit lost now though. Too many things running in my mind… I feel that if I keep polishing this game, I could release it on consoles. At the same time, I also feel like I need to finish it up and move on to different games. It gives me a headache everytime I think about it.</p>

<p>Work is also progressing on my new card game prototype. This week wasn’t so productive, met some friends and got hooked up on the new soccer anime. But still, 22 hours of development isn’t so bad.</p>

        June 4th Week - Getting ready for Early Access release
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">27 Jun 2022</span>

    <p>I have decided on a Steam release date for the game. Haven’t announced it yet because I’m not sure if I can make it D: but I think I can, unless some horrible problem comes up. This week I wrote some story for chapter 2 (I should have done this sooner). I wanted to release the Early Access version with the entirety of chapter 2, but I am not sure I can make it. Which means that early access might launch with half of chapter 2. I have two reasons for that:</p>

<p>1) I did some major rebalancing of the game’s Soul Crush system last week, to test that stuff I need some new simple dev tools
2) The game had some issues for people with big screens and I added that last week
3) The steam page still has screens and trailer from the last version. I might do something about this, not sure.</p>

<p>I decide to rebalance the game now because I want people to be able to import their saves. The rebalance means that advance people will lose their Soul Crush / Challenge Area progress. Figured it was better do that sooner than later.</p>

2022 W:25 hstory     :  3:53:00
2022 W:25 design     :  1:08:00
2022 W:25 monster    :  5:58:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Those hours are nice. Anyways, me and my SO did break up but the relationship was decaying, so that was good in the long run, I believe. Anyways, this week I’ll continue making some debugging tools and make what content I can out of chapter 2. The Steam page overhaul might come later, on the first big update of the game.</p>

<p>It took a long time to release what was supposed to be a very small prototype for some game mechanics… I’m glad I did decide on a deadline for it, because the way I’m working in the game, I could keep developing the game forever. Let us keep going strong!</p>

        June 3rd Week - Steam Next Fest is gone
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">20 Jun 2022</span>

    <p>I release the first build of the game with the new subsystem. It is a resource generation &amp; upgrade crafting system? I guess that is how you could call it. I still need to add more content to it though.</p>

<p>AND STEAM NEXT FEST IS GONE! I mean, kinda, this is the last day. Honestly… Things are complicated. The average Steam player (or at least the audience present at the Steam Next Festivals) isn’t really the same audience as incremental games lol I might write more about this later. But I did learn a lot from the festival!</p>

<p>My hours were pretty high this week because I didn’t go out at all during the weekend. My SO is taking distance and I think we might break up soon hahahaha :( anyways, the next milestone is the Steam Early Access release!!</p>

    <p>Steam Next Fest is tomorrow! And I already messed up lol. On Steam Next Fest you can stream twice. I set one Stream to the wrong time and realizing I couldn’t change the time, I deleted the stream. And Steam won’t let me remake it. :( so I’ll only stream once. This week I have worked a lot on another subsystem that I haven’t talked much about because it’s a bit weird to explain. No idea how to call it lol.</p>

<p>I’m leaning towards working on some other systems before working again on weapon practice. If anyone who reads this wants to try out the current weapon system, do let me know.</p>

  What is Brave Ball?
  </h1>
  Your weapon is a soccer ball. In an action RPG with turn-based mechanics.<br><br>

  If that sounds awesome to you like it does to me, <b>wishlist</b> the game to know when it comes out! <br><br>
  It increases the chances of the game being successful too, which means more updates! And more updates means a better game for everybody!
