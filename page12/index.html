        November 1st Week: Back to Brave Ball a bit
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">09 Nov 2021</span>

    <p>Added new bosses to the prototype!!! They give permanent stat upgrades. I did add further cutscenes to the game, but stopped myself from adding goals. The reason for that is because adding goals would make for a better game, I might not use it in Brave Ball. I might reconsider adding a similar system to Brave Ball though.</p>

<p><strong>BE WARNED</strong></p>

<p><strong>THE PROTOTYPE IS VERY SIMPLE AND BORING. YOU KINDA JUST LEAVE IT RUNNING IN THE BROWSE, CHOOSE YOUR EQUIPMENT AND WHERE TO FIGHT</strong></p>

<p>You can try it here: https://github.com/Pidroh/GenericRPGIdle</p>

<p>I also wrote all the cutscenes that will be in the Brave Ball demo! It was super fun.
Now I need to write code to integrate the cutscenes with the map. Not sure if I should write new map code in Haxe and do the integration in Haxe… Or move over to C# and do it there.</p>

<p>Here is the time table for this week (week 44 of 2021):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2021-11 W:44 hrpg       : 26:33:00
2021-11 W:44 marketing  :  3:47:00
2021-11 W:44 manager    :  3:20:00
2021-11 W:44 auto       :  0:30:00
2021-11 W:44 turn       : 12:28:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>26 hours programming the prototype and 12 hours planning and writing cutscenes for Brave Ball! Not bad!
Right now I’m adding a prestige system to HRPG, which might make it into Brave Ball. This Saturday I’ll make a decision on where to integrate the cutscenes to the map.</p>

<p>Let’s go!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>My times are back to normal hahahaha no more 30 hour programming in a week. Makes sense! I had to stop by the hospital too, which is a huge time drain.</p>

<p>While I have some cutscenes in the game, I’m expanding on that. Also having more clearly defined, visible goals in the game.</p>

<p>This week I got way more work in. This post, though, was supposed to be posted yesterday, so that is bad.
Marketing and designer time went up. I was kinda lost during that designer time, so I’m not sure if it was quality time being spent, but maybe it was necessary.</p>

<p>I have stopped a bit on the RPG mechanics and started to create the code for the story. Hopefully I can get story cutscenes working before Friday but that may be tough.</p>

    <p>So I guess the main news today is the first trial of the Level Up and XP system for Brave Ball. I am not sure if I want to go with fixed XP per level and weak enemies giving less XP, or if I just go with higher and higher XP flowing in. Right now I’ll just leave the higher and higher XP values.</p>

<p>However, the initial balance is bad! You’re gonna have a hard time before you get your first level up.</p>

<p>This week I got little work in. I was a bit busy in the weekend and I have been feeling a bit sick (some bad nutritional choices I plan to fix this week, way too much powdered food, fiber and caffeine dehydrating me). Next weekend I’ll be less busy so I think I can bring those numbers up.</p>

<p>Marketing is now down to one hour. This has a reason though, this is because I decided to move some marketing activities to Monday (which resulted in almost no big marketing for that week, kinda of delaying some posts).</p>

<p>This week the haxe prototype continues BUT I am also writing a bit the story of Brave Ball. By knowing exactly where I want the demo to end, I can start think about how I am going to order the art I need for the game. With this, I can draw a budget for the game. I hope.</p>

    <p>Brave Ball went strong on Steam Fest!</p>

<p><img src="/website/assets/steamfest.png" alt="Brave Ball on Steam Fest screenshot" /></p>

<p>I’m currently prototyping the RPG mechanics as a browser game!
And soon <strong>everyone</strong> will be able to play the prototype! That means you, reader!</p>

<p>Currently the balance is super bad though. And it’s an idle game, so, not sure if everyone will like it.</p>

<p>I’ll post a link here in October 18th!!</p>

<p>Here is the time table for this week (week 40 of 2021):</p>

<p>Around 23 hours of programming in!!! Nice!</p>

<p>Marketing is now down to 3 hours. This makes sense because I didn’t really have any new screenshots to show or pages to seetup.</p>

<p>This week is mainly the haxe prototype but I am kinda stuck in knowing how much I should balance VS adding new features. Hard to make a prototype fun when it doesn’t have enough features.</p>

  What is Brave Ball?
  </h1>
  Your weapon is a soccer ball. In an action RPG with turn-based mechanics.<br><br>

  If that sounds awesome to you like it does to me, <b>wishlist</b> the game to know when it comes out! <br><br>
  It increases the chances of the game being successful too, which means more updates! And more updates means a better game for everybody!
