        February 4th Week - Slowly remaking (IV)
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">28 Feb 2022</span>

    <p>I added a title screen to the remake version. I have also posted the remake version directly on Feedback Friday for the first time. Got me nervous there.</p>

<p>You can try the original version here: https://pidroh.github.io/GenericRPGIdle/
You can try the remake here: https://pidroh.github.io/GenericRPGIdle/unstable_phaser</p>

<p>The remake has much better performance and will be the basis for the Steam version, so I will be focusing all development there.</p>

<p>Fixed some stuff on specific types of equipment. Got the remake running on Unity.</p>

<p>Here is the time table for this week (week 8 of 2022):</p>

2022 W:08 designer   :  1:08:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Got some nice performance this week since I stayed home for the weekend. That being said, I did find out that it is a submission process, which fails some people, for getting your game on Switch. I somehow thought it was super easy to get in. So being sucessful on Steam or another console would be a requirement. Life is complex hahaha. Not sure if I can realize my 2022 goal of publishing a game in consoles.</p>

<p>And off we go!</p>

    <p>The region UI is now functional in the remake, but not complete yet. I fixed a lot of the problems with the equipment screen UI too.
I am now remaking the title screen UI!</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Nice performance in general, but somehow I failed to track my designer hours, so it’s probably mixed with the game’s hours. I think.</p>

    <p>Not a lot of progress this week. Mainly worked on the in-battle area display. Also did a mockup for the new Region UI.</p>

<p>Some pictures to illustrate how it is going:</p>

<p>This week Friday was a holiday, so that was nice. But I went on a trip for the weekend, which ate up a bunch of hours. This week I hope to be able to get the region / area tab functional. Then I’ll need to fix up the problems in the equipment UI. After that work on buff visualization and set selection.</p>

<p>And off we go!</p>

    <p>Made some great progress on the equipment screen. I also implemented some requests from players to the on-air version.</p>

<p>37 hours in on GRI again! Once again, good numbers!</p>

<p>So my path has been:
Haxe UI =&gt; Pure KHA =&gt; Haxe JS Canvas =&gt; Haxe Phaser.js</p>

<p>And I think I’ll stick with Phaser, it seems to be reliable. Steam will probably use Electron. If I port to consoles, then I guess I’ll port to Unity.</p>

<p>February is here! And also, happy Chinese new year to those who celebrate it!</p>

    <p>My new custom made renderer and UI system is starting to get pretty stable, so I’ll keep building the game. Next week I’ll see if I can get a playable build to gather some feedback.</p>

  What is Brave Ball?
  </h1>
  Your weapon is a soccer ball. In an action RPG with turn-based mechanics.<br><br>

  If that sounds awesome to you like it does to me, <b>wishlist</b> the game to know when it comes out! <br><br>
  It increases the chances of the game being successful too, which means more updates! And more updates means a better game for everybody!
