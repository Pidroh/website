        May 1st Week - The Road to Steam Next Fest

    <p>I managed to fix the Steam save issues I was having!! Thank God!
This week I have been grinding away at all the problems of the new story cutscenes. And there are a lot of small problems… Maybe by next week I can get this new content out? Possibly not.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Got a nice amount of programming, but I skipped some other weekly tasks I have. I used to do a design re-evaluation every Saturday, but I’m thinking of changing when I do that. And besides, now that I’m focusing on content it feels less necessary…?</p>

<p>Just a month until Steam Next Fest D:</p>

    <p>Got some Steam feedback and already fixed it. Then found that saves are getting broken lol. And struggling to fix it. I added set support so I should have the foundation for the new content. I have also written 11 new cutscenes for the game. Still haven’t added them though.</p>

    <p>Launched the playtest on Steam! Added animations to the game, revamped the UI, redid a bunch of UI stuff. The game should look and feel better.</p>

<p>This week was remarkably better than the last on. Nothing in particular to comment on. I am now adding back ‘equipment set’ support. This will be important in adding more content to the game as players will need to use different builds. Right now optimizing speed and using pierce spells is the dominant strategy, which I want to diversify from before the early access release.</p>

    <p>Added some popups, did some stuff with keyboard support, reorganized the beginning of the game a bit.</p>

<p>This week… Was bad. My worst week in a long time lol. I guess the weekend wasn’t productive at all. And the week days also were not the best. I want to improve that by getting by sleep schedule in good pace.</p>

<p>Right now I’m redoing some stuff on the UI after some complaints. Things hopefully will look and feel better.</p>

    <p>I fixed some small bugs and added some small features.  I tried to optimize the draw calls for the unity version but that was a can of worms. I don’t think I’ll do that for now.</p>

<p>This week I will work tweaking the beginning of the game to make it more accessible. No big deal though. I also want to add keyboard support for popup messages. After that I’ll continue work on the feedback window. After that it’s either achievements or gamepad support.</p>

<p>Gotta keep going [2]</p>
