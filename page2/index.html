    <p><strong>GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>I got the sound effects! Am now waiting for music and press release writing.
I will probably pitch Generic RPG Idle to Nintendo on December or January. Hope they reply fast.</p>

<hr />

<p>Here is the time table for this week and last week (week 49 of 2022):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2022 W:49 engine     : 46:33:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I spent 46 hours just hacking away at the engine. I managed to greatly optimize my code, but it’s hard to use all of the optimized code in Generic RPG Idle. I do think that for the next GRI update performance should increase a fair bit. Not sure when that next update will be as I’m doing a lot of waiting for other people and my plans will change depending on Nintendo’s reply. The engine will be used on my future games.</p>

<p>Anyways, let’s keep going!</p>

    <p><strong>GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>Still waiting for the sound effects… [2]
This week, as a preparation for the future, I have started to see how I can optimize my engine.
I have optimized some stuff on GRI (and broke other things in the process…), so FPS in the next build should hopefully be a bit higher.</p>

<hr />

<p>Here is the time table for this week and last week (week 48 of 2022):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2022 W:48 gamejam    :  2:22:00
2022 W:48 manager    :  0:23:00
2022 W:48 hrpg       : 33:14:00
2022 W:48 monster    : 18:50:00
2022 W:48 feedback   :  0:00:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Productivity was very nice. Mainly because trying to optimize the rendering engine is really engaging. It’s really addictive to try to do it.</p>

<p>Let’s goo!</p>

    <p><strong>GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>Still waiting for the sound effects… Also waiting for an animation for the card game.
I also took some time to work on a game jam! I couldn’t actually submit (first time in my life that I enter in a gamejam and don’t submit). The main reason is because I wanted to implement a very specific battle system and prioritized that more than the game jam. I didn’t even finish the game logic.</p>

<p>Next GRI update:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sounds and music, new animations and effects</li>
  <li>MAYBE: more unknown tab content</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Here is the time table for this week and last week (week 47 of 2022):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2022 W:47 monster    :  4:59:00
2022 W:47 manager    :  2:09:00
2022 W:47 hrpg       : 21:50:00
2022 W:47 study      :  4:27:00
2022 W:47 gamejam    : 13:27:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Productivity was nice.
For a couple of the next weeks, I think the time I use on GRI (hrpg) will become a bit lower. I am currently preparing to send the game to Nintendo and I’ll wait a bit for their response.</p>

<p>Let’s goo!</p>

    <p><strong>GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>The sound guy is working on the game and it is taking time.
Meanwhile, I just do some small fixes and additions in Generic RPG Idle.
As for the card game, I spent the whole weekend preparing the base material for an animation. It was a bit crazy.</p>

<p>Next GRI update:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sounds and music, new animations and effects</li>
  <li>MAYBE: more unknown tab content</li>
</ul>

2022 W:46 study      :  0:20:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Productivity didn’t change much from last week. Spent less time studying and more time pixeling. It was the first time I spend over 10 hours on Aseprite. Hopefully it pays off soon.</p>

<p>Best in life to all!</p>

        November 2nd week - Aftermath!

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">14 Nov 2022</span>

    <p><strong>GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>I worked on implementing some animations I had ordered from pixel artists into the game. It is still not done as there is a bit of programming backbone to make it.</p>

<p>Since one of the players has cleared all of the unknown tab content I feel like I want to increase the priority of adding more unknown tab content to the game. We’ll see how it goes.</p>

<p>As for the card game, I spent time on the Steam page and researching some stuff. I should be announcing something next Month. Might get delayed.</p>

<p>Next update:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sounds and music, new animations and effects</li>
  <li>MAYBE: more unknown tab content</li>
</ul>

<p>The sound guy I found should start working on it today. It’s going to cost quite a bit of money but let’s see how it goes.</p>

<p>The polish criteria is still this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How easily reusable is this improvement for other projects?</li>
  <li>How fast can I make it?</li>
  <li>Do I have a good reference to use when making the polish?</li>
  <li>Does the polish look good on trailers?</li>
  <li>Does the polish make the game easier to understand?
    <ul>
      <li>makes it easier for people who just started to understand the game</li>
      <li>visualized that actions happened</li>
      <li>how actions actually work</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How often will new players see this polish?</li>
  <li>how often will long-term players see this polish?</li>
  <li>Is the polish making the game prettier but less enjoyable to play somehow?</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Here is the time table for this week and last week (week 45 of 2022):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2022 W:45 manager    :  0:15:00
2022 W:45 monster    : 18:10:00
2022 W:45 study      :  4:35:00
2022 W:45 hrpg       : 18:20:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Productivity is good, I think. Time spent in the card game (monster) and in GRI (hrpg) are around the same. I spent four hours studying indie game development process too, which will be nice for both the card game and my next titles. Hopefully.</p>

<p>Best in life to all!</p>

  What is Brave Ball?

  Your weapon is a soccer ball. In an action RPG with turn-based mechanics.<br><br>

  If that sounds awesome to you like it does to me, <b>wishlist</b> the game to know when it comes out! <br><br>
  It increases the chances of the game being successful too, which means more updates! And more updates means a better game for everybody!
