        June 2nd Week - The Road to Steam Next Fest (VII)

    <p>Steam Next Fest is tomorrow! And I already messed up lol. On Steam Next Fest you can stream twice. I set one Stream to the wrong time and realizing I couldn’t change the time, I deleted the stream. And Steam won’t let me remake it. :( so I’ll only stream once. This week I have worked a lot on another subsystem that I haven’t talked much about because it’s a bit weird to explain. No idea how to call it lol.</p>

<p>I’m leaning towards working on some other systems before working again on weapon practice. If anyone who reads this wants to try out the current weapon system, do let me know.</p>

    <p>Steam Next Fest starts in one week!!! And the weapon practice system isn’t as fun as I had hoped :( not sure if I’ll release the system as it is and try to get feedback on it or if I’ll just try to improve it before release.</p>

    <p>Just coding the new weapon practice system. Not much to add… Steam Next Fest starts in exactly two weeks! Maybe I’ll release the first version of the new weapon practice system then? Just make sure to say it is not complete. Not sure if it will be in a good state by then, but we’ll see.</p>

<p>The hours are much better than last week. Guess I had a good productive weekend to help boost that. But I did get burned out a bit and didn’t do anything Sunday night. Called my gradma back in Brazil… I’m such a terrible grandson though :( was supposed to call on her birthday but just kept postponing it… Felt guilty.</p>

    <p>Focused a bit more on polish and then went back to coding the weapon practice system. The system is starting to take shape. I’m now considering if I should update my Steam page before Steam Next Fest.</p>

<p>The hours are okay? Don’t know if something happened specifically. Anyways, guess I’ll keep going… Really unsure if I focus on the Steam page or just focus on getting more content into the game. :(</p>

    <p>I was going to add more polish to the demo but ended up coding a new system lol but I’ll reevaluate stuff to polish from tomorrow. I also tried posting a video devlog on the incremental sub reddit but that wasn’t such a good idea. The video is too boring if you don’t edit it and all.</p>

<p>The hours are nice. But the new system that I started coding is being a seed to stress. It’s one small system that is supposed to be part of a bigger system which also relates to the future games I can make. This makes me think about a thousand things. I’m a bit discouraged right now about the game and keep stressing myself out thinking about working on other games.</p>

  What is Brave Ball?

  Your weapon is a soccer ball. In an action RPG with turn-based mechanics.<br><br>

  If that sounds awesome to you like it does to me, <b>wishlist</b> the game to know when it comes out! <br><br>
  It increases the chances of the game being successful too, which means more updates! And more updates means a better game for everybody!
