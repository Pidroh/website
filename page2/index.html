        March Week 1 - GRI is back and the rise of Nostalpix

    <p><strong>CARD NOVA / GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>I wrote a bunch of cutscenes for GRI and worked on the achievement system. Current the project put on hold is now Neos. Since I have a deadline for Steam next fest now, unfortunately I don’t now how much I want to invest into Neos.</p>

<p>So I am working on something called Nostalpix. It’s related to Card Nova Hyper. I’ll be able to unveil Nostalpix within the next 10 days. Nostalpix was supposed to get a trailer, but I think it will be unveiled first without a trailer while I work on the trailer. Unless things line up magically lol. Well, we’ll see.</p>

<p>This week will see more GRI cutscenes and maybe more work on achievements too. Not sure if I can write every cutscene this week, probably not.</p>

<hr />

<p>Here is the time table for week 9 of 2023:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2023 W:09 neos       :  2:07:00
2023 W:09 monster    : 22:02:00
2023 W:09 hrpg       : 11:05:00
2023 W:09 manager    :  1:44:00
2023 W:09 burocracy  :  0:03:00
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>So yeah, the numbers are far from peak numbers… I was a bit busy during the weekend too. I guess anything around 30 hours is good enough considering I have a full time job.</p>

<p>I personally can’t wait to see what will happen around Nostalpix.</p>

<p>Godspeed!</p>

        February Week 4 - Daddy's home! I mean Gri's home

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">27 Feb 2023</span>

    <p><strong>CARD NOVA / GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>Ok, three weeks are done. I’m back at GRI. Already did some stuff today. Created a new bundle for Generic RPG Idle + Daily Espada! This will give a discount to people who own one game but not the other. https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/30487/Darkness_of_Brazil/</p>

<p>So this week I did more Card Nova Hyper prototype polishing. Finished setting up Neos and have started adding support for big numbers to the engine. Those are necessary for bigger numbers to be handled by the program correctly.</p>

<p>I have also released the browser version of GRI on Armor Games! That release is going quite well. https://armorgames.com/generic-rpg-idle-sound-of-art-game/19338</p>

<p>I’m currently supposed to be preparing a new Steam page for a project related to Card Nova Hyper… But no idea if the Steam page will open up with a trailer or if I’ll add a trailer later. I think it’s a bit too late to try and add a really good trailer before March 16. I can make an okay-ish trailer by then though, I believe. Not too sure on if it’s better to have no trailer or a “mediocre” trailer…</p>

<hr />

<p>Here is the time table for week 8 of 2023:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2023 W:08 monster    : 23:22:00
2023 W:08 marketing  :  1:56:00
2023 W:08 manager    :  3:04:00
2023 W:08 neos       :  8:37:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>More productive than last week, which is nice.
Anyways, for this week with GRI, I am going to iterate a bit on Steam assets, I think. Then I’ll go back to writing chapter 3. I wonder if I’ll end up splitting chapter 3 into two chapters. I don’t think so but who knows… We’ll see how it goes.</p>

<p>Let’s goo!</p>

        February Week 3 - One Last Week of no GRI

    <span class="post-date">20 Feb 2023</span>

    <p><strong>CARD NOVA / GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>Second week of the Generic RPG Idle (GRI) break. This coming week will be the last one.</p>

<p>Card Nova Hyper is going with me ordering more character art and developing the prototype. I am also setting up things for project Neos, but that is all it is right now, setting up. This setup phase is taking a lot of time. I want to believe it’s worth it but I’m not sure at times. Once Neos starts heating up (if it does heat up since I still have to finish GRI) the new workflow I’m setting up will be useful.</p>

<hr />

<p>Here is the time table for week 7 of 2023:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2023 W:07 monster    : 22:08:00
2023 W:07 neos       : 11:47:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So yeah, this week wasn’t so productive compared to the others. Still a lot of hours though. But yeah, I’m looking forward to Steam Next Fest and how that might boost Card Nova Hyper AND get me feedback on the prototype I’m working on. Also a bit scared lol.</p>

<p>A wonderful user pointed out performance degradation issues. This means I might have to move GRI to the new technology stack chain before final release. Not sure if this is happening or not. I think I’ll make a decision once the final achievements + story reaches beta.</p>

<p>Let’s goo!</p>

    <p><strong>CARD NOVA / GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>Ok, first week of a break from Generic RPG Idle. Feels weird.
My computer suddenly had a battery issue. Took me 3 days to fix that. I worked using another computer in the mean time but since I didn’t wanna setup my projects on the other computer, I didn’t work much. I did work though.</p>

<p>Card Nova Hyper I have recently changed the small capsule and the first screenshot of the game. Hopefully this improves the performance of the Steam page. You can see the new screenshot here:
https://store.steampowered.com/app/2197330/CARD_NOVA_HYPER/
And the new capsule by clicking here:
https://store.steampowered.com/search/?term=card+nova+hyper</p>

<p>My card game prototype is also going great. I’m not feature complete but I’m close. Steam Next Fest registration is up until March 16 so I’ll see if I can make that deadline for a little spin off title!</p>

<hr />

<p>Here is the time table for week 6 of 2023:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2023 W:06 manager    :  2:36:00
2023 W:06 monster    : 33:57:00
2023 W:06 hrpg       :  0:14:00
2023 W:06 burocracy  :  0:32:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>SO yeah, computer broken, less hours worked on the game. But things are going.
This week I’ll also rest on GRI. And then the next one I’ll rest too. After that development should resume.</p>

<p>Let’s goo!</p>

    <p><strong>CARD NOVA / GENERIC RPG WEEKLY REPORT</strong></p>

<p>Last days to get Generic RPG Idle!!
This week I ended up doing 10 hours of Generic RPG Idle related tasks! Considering I wanted to take a 3/4 week break from it, I failed lol.</p>

<hr />

<p>Here is the time table for week 5 of 2023:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>2023 W:05 monster    : 30:48:00
2023 W:05 hrpg       : 10:43:00
2023 W:05 manager    :  3:14:00
2023 W:05 neos       :  1:27:00
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>8 hours of streaming this week! And on only 3 days. It really helps concentration!
Since I don’t wanna build just the card game while I’m taking a break from GRI, I’m thinking about starting on the next prototype.</p>

<p>This new update set a new record of sales for GRI, so that was awesome!! Thanks everyone for your support!</p>

  What is Brave Ball?

  Your weapon is a soccer ball. In an action RPG with turn-based mechanics.<br><br>

  If that sounds awesome to you like it does to me, <b>wishlist</b> the game to know when it comes out! <br><br>
  It increases the chances of the game being successful too, which means more updates! And more updates means a better game for everybody!
